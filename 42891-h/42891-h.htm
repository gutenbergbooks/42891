<h3><i>THE HIGHER CRITICISM.</i></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"God shows all things in the slow history of their ripening."&mdash;<span class="smcap">George
Eliot.</span></p></blockquote>


<p>God has given us many Bibles. The book which
we call the Bible consists of a series of books,
and its name represents the Greek plural &#964;&#8048; &#914;&#8055;&#946;&#955;&#953;&#945;.
It is not so much a book, as the extant fragments of
a literature, which grew up during many centuries.
Supreme as is the importance of this "Book of God,"
it was never meant to be the sole teacher of mankind.
We mistake its purpose, we misapply its revelation,
when we use it to exclude the other sources of religious
knowledge. It is supremely profitable for our instruction,
but, so far from being designed to absorb our
exclusive attention, its work is to stimulate the eagerness
with which, by its aid, we are able to learn from
all other sources the will of God towards men.</p>

<p>God speaks to us in many voices. In the Bible
He revealed Himself to all mankind by His messages
to the individual souls of some of His servants. But
those messages, whether uttered or consigned to writing,
were but one method of enabling us to hold communion
with Him. They were not even an <i>indispensable</i>
method. Thousands of the saints of God lived the
spiritual life in close communion with their Father in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
heaven in ages which possessed no written book; in
ages before any such book existed; in ages during
which, though it existed, it was practically inaccessible;
in ages during which it had been designedly kept out
of their hands by priests. This fact should quicken
our sense of gratitude for the inestimable boon of a
Book wherein he who runs may now read, and respecting
the main teaching of which wayfaring men, and
even fools, need not err. But it should at the same
time save us from the error of treating the Bible as
though it were in itself an amulet or a fetish, as the
Mohammedan treats his Koran. The Bible was written
in human language, by men for men. It was written
mainly in Judæa, by Jews, for Jews. "<i>Scripture</i>," as
the old theological rule said, "<i>is the sense of Scripture</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and the sense of Scripture can only be ascertained by
the methods of study and the rules of criticism without
which no ancient document or literature can be even
approximately understood. In these respects the Bible
cannot be arbitrarily or exceptionally treated. No
<i>a priori</i> rules can be devised for its elucidation. It
is what it is, not what we might have expected it to
be. Language, at the best, is an imperfect and ever-varying
instrument of thought. It is full of twilight,
and of gracious shadows. Vast numbers of its words
were originally metaphorical. When the light of
metaphor has faded from them they come to mean different
things at different times, under different conditions,
in different contexts, on different lips. Language can
at the best be but an <i>asymptote</i> to thought; in other
words, it resembles the mathematical line which approaches
nearer and nearer to the circumference of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
a circle, but which, even when infinitely extended, can
never actually touch it. The fact that the Bible contains
a Divine revelation does not alter the fact that
it represents a nation's literature. It is the library
of the Jewish people, or rather all that remains to
us of that library, and all that was most precious in it.
Holy men of old were moved by the Spirit of God, but
as this Divine inspiration did not make them personally
sinless in their actions, or infallible in their judgments,
so neither does it exempt their messages from the
limitation which attaches to all human conditions.
Criticism would have rendered an inestimable service
to every thoughtful reader of the Scriptures if it had
done nothing more than impress upon them that the
component books are not one, but complex and multiform,
separated from each other by centuries of time,
and of very varying value and preciousness. They too,
like the greatest apostles of God, have their treasure
in earthen vessels; and we not only may, but must,
by the aid of that reason which is "the candle of the
Lord," estimate both the value of the treasure, and
the age and character of the earthen vessel in which
it is contained.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of texts in Scripture which may
convey to some souls a very true and blessed meaning,
but which do not in the original possess any such
meaning as that which is now attached to them. The
words of Hebrew prophets often seem perfectly clear,
but in some cases they had another set of connotations
in the mouths of those by whom they were originally
spoken. It requires a learned and a literary training
to discover by philology, by history, or by comparison,
what alone they could have meant when they were
first spoken. In many cases their exact significance is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
no longer to be ascertained with certainty. It must be
more or less conjectural. There are passages of Scripture
which have received scores of differing interpretations.
There are entire books of Scripture about the
general scope of which there have been diametrically
opposite opinions. The spiritual intuition of the saint
may in some instances be keener to read aright than
the laborious researches of the scholar, because spiritual
things can only be spiritually discerned. But in general
it is true that the <i>ex cathedra</i> assertions of ignorant
readers, though they are often pronounced with an
assumption of infallibility, are not worth the breath
which utters them. All artificial dogmas as to what
Scripture <i>must</i> be, and <i>must</i> mean, are worse than idle;
we have only to deal with what it <i>really is</i>, and what
it <i>really says</i>. Even when opinions respecting it have
been all but unanimously pronounced by the representatives
of all the Churches, they have nevertheless been
again and again shown to be absurdly erroneous. The
slow light of scholarship, of criticism, of comparative
religion, has proved that in many instances not only
the interpretations of former ages, but the very <i>principles</i>
of interpretation from which they were derived,
had no basis whatever in fact. And the methods of
interpretation&mdash;dogmatic, ecclesiastical, mystic, allegorical,
literal&mdash;have changed from age to age.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The
asserted heresy of yesterday has in scores of instances
become the accepted commonplace of to-morrow. The
duty of the Church in the present day is neither to
make out that the Bible is what men have imagined
that it was, nor to repeat the assertions of ancient
writers as to what they declared it to be, but honestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
and truthfully to discover the significance of the actual
phenomena which it presents to the enlightened and
cultivated intelligence.</p>

<p>If it were not so common a failing to ignore the
lessons of the past, it might have been hoped that a
certain modesty, of which the necessity is taught us
by centuries of error, would have saved a multitude of
writers from rushing into premature and denunciative
rejection of results which they have not studied, and of
which they are incapable to judge. St. Jerome complained
that in his day there was no old woman so
fatuous as not to assume the right to lay down the law
about Scriptural interpretation. It is just the same
in these days. Half-taught dogmatists&mdash;&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#963;&#967;&#8051;&#948;&#953;&#959;&#953;
&#948;&#959;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#8054;, as they have been called&mdash;may sweepingly
condemn the lifelong researches of men far superior to
themselves, not only in learning, but in love of truth;
they may attribute their conclusions to faithless infatuation,
and even to moral obliquity. This has been done
over and over again in our own lifetime; and yet such
self-constituted and unauthorised defenders of their own
prejudices and traditions&mdash;which they always identify
with the Catholic faith&mdash;are impotent to prevent, impotent
even greatly to retard, the spread of real
knowledge. Many of the now-accepted certainties of
science were repudiated a generation ago as absurd and
blasphemous. As long as it was possible to put them
down by persecution, the thumbscrew and the stake
were freely used by priests and inquisitors for their
suppression. <i>E pur si muove.</i> Theologians who
mingled the gold of Revelation with the clay of their
own opinions have been driven to correct their past
errors. Untaught by experience, religious prejudice is
ever heaping up fresh obstacles to oppose the progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
of new truths. The obstacles will be swept away in
the future as surely as they have been in the past.
The eagle, it has been said, which soars through the
air does not worry itself how to cross the rivers.</p>

<p>It is probable that no age since that of the Apostles
has added so much to our knowledge of the true
meaning and history of the Bible as has been added
by our own. The mode of regarding Scripture has
been almost revolutionised, and in consequence many
books of Scripture previously misunderstood have
acquired a reality and intensity of interest and instructiveness
which have rendered them trebly precious.
A deeper and holier reverence for all eternal truth
which the Bible contains has taken the place of a
meaningless letter worship. The fatal and wooden
Rabbinic dogma of verbal dictation&mdash;a dogma which
either destroys intelligent faith altogether, or introduces
into Christian conduct some of the worst delusions
of false religion&mdash;is dead and buried in every capable
and well-taught mind. Truths which had long been
seen through the distorting mirage of false exegesis
have now been set forth in their true aspect. We
have been enabled, for the first time, to grasp the real
character of events which, by being set in a wrong
perspective, had been made so fantastic as to have no
relation to ordinary lives. Figures which had become
dim spectres moving through an unnatural atmosphere
now stand out, full of grace, instructiveness and warning,
in the clear light of day. The science of Biblical
criticism has solved scores of enigmas which were once
disastrously obscure, and has brought out the original
beauty of some passages, which, even in our Authorised
Version, conveyed no intelligible meaning to earnest
readers. The Revised Version alone has corrected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
hundreds of inaccuracies which in some instances defaced
the beauty of the sacred page, and in many others misrepresented
and mistranslated it. Intolerance has been
robbed of favourite shibboleths, used as the basis of
cruel beliefs, which souls unhardened by system could
only repudiate with a "God forbid!" Familiar error
has ever been dearer to most men than unfamiliar
truths; but truth, however slow may seem to be the
beat of her pinions, always wins her way at last.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Can there be any doubt that mankind has everything
to gain and nothing to lose from the ascertainment of
genuine truth? Are we so wholly devoid of even an
elementary faith as to think that man can profit by
consciously cherished illusions? Does it not show a
nobler confidence in facts to correct traditional prejudices,
than to rest blindly content with conventional assertions?
If we do not believe that God is a God of truth, that
all falsity is hateful to Him,&mdash;and religious falsity most
hateful of all, because it adds the sin of hypocrisy to
the love of lies,&mdash;we believe in <i>nothing</i>. If our religion
is to consist in a rejection of knowledge, lest it should
disturb the convictions of times of ignorance, the dicta
of "the Fathers," or dogmas which arrogate to themselves
the sham claim of Catholicity&mdash;if we are to give
only to the Dark Ages the title of the Ages of Faith,
then indeed</p>

<p>"There is and will be much discussion," says Goethe,
"as to the advantage or disadvantage of the popular
dissemination of the Bible. To me it is clear that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
will be mischievous, as it always has been, if used
dogmatically and capriciously; beneficial, as it always
has been, if accepted didactically (for our instruction)
and with feeling." There is abundance in the Bible
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
in righteousness;&mdash;we shall weaken its moral and
spiritual force, and gain nothing in its place, if we turn
it into an idol adorned with impossible claims which it
never makes for itself, and if we support its golden
image upon the brittle clay of an exegesis which is
morally, critically, and historically false.</p>

<p>I do not see how there can be any loss in the
positive results of what is called the Higher Criticism.
Certainly its suggestions must never be hastily adopted.
Nor is it likely that they will be. They have to fight
their way through crowds of opposing prejudices.
They are first held up to ridicule as absurd; then
exposed to anathema as irreligious; at last they are
accepted as obviously true. The very theologians who
once denounced them silently ignore or readjust what
they previously preached, and hasten, first to minimise
the importance, then to extol the value of the new discoveries.
It is quite right that they should be keenly
scrutinised. All new sciences are liable to rush into
extremes. Their first discoverers are misled into error
by premature generalisations born of a genuine enthusiasm.
They are tempted to build elaborate superstructures
on inadequate foundations. But when they
have established certain irrefragable principles, can
the obvious deductions from those principles be other
than a pure gain? Can we be the better for traditional
delusions? Can mistakes and ignorance&mdash;can anything
but the ascertained fact&mdash;be desirable for man, or
acceptable to God?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>No doubt it is with a sensation of pain that we
are compelled to give up convictions which we once
regarded as indubitable and sacred. That is a part
of our human nature. We must say with all gentleness
to the passionate devotees of each old erroneous
<i>mumpsimus</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Disce; sed ira cadat naso rugosaque sanna<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Cum veteres avias tibi de pulmone revello."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Our blessed Lord, with His consummate tenderness,
and Divine insight into the frailties of our nature, made
tolerant allowance for inveterate prejudices. "No
man," He said, "having drunk old wine straightway
desireth new: for he saith, The old is good." But the
pain of disillusionment is blessed and healing when
it is incurred in the cause of sincerity. There must
always be more value in results earned by heroic
labour than in conventions accepted without serious
inquiry. Already there has been a silent revolution.
Many of the old opinions about the Bible have been
greatly modified. There is scarcely a single competent
scholar who does not now admit that the Hexateuch
is a composite structure; that much of the Levitical
legislation, which was once called Mosaic, is in reality
an aftergrowth which <i>in its present form</i> is not earlier
than the days of the prophet Ezekiel; that the Book
of Deuteronomy belongs, in its present form, whatever
older elements it may contain, to the era of Hezekiah's
or Josiah's reformation; that the Books of Zechariah
and Isaiah are not homogeneous, but preserve the
writings of more prophets than their titles imply; that
only a small section of the Psalter was the work of
David; that the Book of Ecclesiastes was not the work
of King Solomon; that most of the Book of Daniel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
belongs to the era of Antiochus Epiphanes; and so
forth. In what respect is the Bible less precious, less
"inspired" in the only tenable sense of that very
undefined word, in consequence of such discoveries?
In what way do they touch the outermost fringe of
our Christian faith? Is there anything in such results
of modern criticism which militates against the most
inferential expansion of a single clause in the Apostolic,
the Nicene, or even the Athanasian Creed? Do they
contravene one single syllable of the hundreds of
propositions to which our assent is demanded in the
Thirty-nine Articles? I would gladly help to mitigate
the needless anxiety felt by many religious minds.
When the Higher Criticism is in question I would
ask them to distinguish between established premisses
and the exorbitant system of inferences which a few
writers have based upon them. They may rest assured
that sweeping conclusions will not be hastily snatched
up; that no conclusion will be regarded as proved
until it has successfully run the gauntlet of many a
jealous challenge. They need not fear for one moment
that the Ark of their faith is in peril, and they will
be guilty not only of unwisdom but of profanity if
they rush forward to support it with rude and unauthorised
hands. There never has been an age of
deep thought and earnest inquiry which has not left
its mark in the modification of some traditions or
doctrines of theology. But the truths of essential
Christianity are built upon a rock. They belong to
things which cannot be shaken, and which remain.
The intense labours of eminent scholars, English and
German, thanklessly as they have been received, have
not robbed us of so much as a fraction of a single
precious element of revelation. On the contrary, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
have cleared the Bible of many accretions by which
its meaning was spoilt, and its doctrines wrested to
perdition, and they have thus rendered it more profitable
than before for every purpose for which it was
designed, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly
furnished unto all good works.</p>

<p>When we study the Bible it is surely one of our
most primary duties to beware lest any idols of the
caverns or of the forum tempt us "to offer to the God
of truth the unclean sacrifice of a lie."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE BOOKS OF KINGS.</i></h3>


<p>The "Two Books of Kings," as we call them, are
only one book (Sepher Melakîm), and were so
regarded not only in the days of Origen (<i>ap.</i> Euseb.,
<i>H. E.</i>, vi. 25) and of Jerome (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 420), but by the
Jews even down to Bomberg's Hebrew Bible of
1518. They are treated as one book in the Talmud
and the Peshito. The Western Bibles followed the
Alexandrian division into two books (called the third
and fourth of Kings), and Jerome adopted this division
in the Vulgate (<i>Regum</i>, iii. et iv.). But if this separation
into two books was due to the LXX. translators,
they should have made a less awkward and artificial
division than the one which breaks off the first book
in the middle of the brief reign of Ahaziah. Jerome's
version of the Books of Samuel and Kings appeared
first of his translations, and in his famous <i>Prologus
Galeatus</i> he mentions these facts.</p>

<p>The History was intended to be a continuation of
the Books of Samuel. Some critics, and among them
Ewald, assign them to the same author, but closer
examination of the Book of Kings renders this more
than doubtful. The incessant use of the prefix "King,"
the extreme frequency of the description "Man of
God," the references to the law, and above all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
constant condemnation of high places, counterbalance
the minor resemblance of style, and prove a difference
of authorship.</p>

<p>What has the Higher Criticism, as represented in
historic sequence by such writers as Vatke, de Wette,
Reuss, Graf, Ewald, Kuenen, Bleek, Wellhausen, Stade,
Kittel, Renan, Klostermann, Cheyne, Driver, Robertson
Smith, and others, to tell us about the structure
and historic credibility of the Books of Kings? Has
it in any way shaken their value, while it has undoubtedly
added to their intelligibility and interest?</p>

<p>1. It emphasises the fact that they are a compilation.
In this there is nothing either new or startling, for the
fact is plainly and repeatedly acknowledged in the page
of the sacred narrative. The sources utilised are:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The Book of the Acts of Solomon (1 Kings
xi. 41).</p>

<p>(2) The Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah
(referred to fifteen times).</p>

<p>(3) The Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel
(referred to seventeen times).<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>By comparing the authority referred to in 1 Kings
xi. 41 with those quoted in 2 Chron. ix. 29, we see
that "the Book of the Acts of Solomon" must have
been to a large extent identical with the annals of that
king's reign contained in "the Book (R.V., Histories)
of Nathan the Prophet," the prophecy of Ahijah the
Shilonite, and "the story (R.V., commentary) or
visions of Iddo the Seer."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Similarly it appears that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the Acts of Rehoboam, Abijam, Jehoshaphat, Uzziah,
were compiled, at any rate in part, from the histories of
Shemaiah, Jehu the son of Hanani,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Isaiah the son of
Amoz, Hozai (2 Chron. xxxiii. 18, R.V.), and other
seers. In the narrative of a history of 450 years (from
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1016 to 562) the writer was of course compelled
to rely for his facts upon more ancient authorities.
Whether he consulted the original documents in the
archives of Jerusalem, or whether he utilised some outline
of them which had previously been drawn up,
cannot easily be determined. The work would have
been impossible but for the existence of the officials
known as recorders and historiographers (<i>Mazkirim,
Sopherim</i>), who first make their appearance in the court
of David. But the <i>original</i> documents could hardly
have survived the ravages of Shalmanezer in Samaria
and of Nebuchadnezzar in Jerusalem, so that Movers
is probably right in the conjecture that the author's
extracts were made, not immediately, but from the
epitome of an earlier compiler.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>2. Although no direct quotations are referred to other
documents, it seems certain from the style, and from
various minor touches, that the compiler also utilised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
detailed accounts of great prophets like Elijah, Elisha,
and Micaiah son of Imlah, which had been drawn up
by literary students in the Schools of the Prophets.
The stories of prophets and men of God who are left
unnamed were derived from oral traditions so old that
the names had been forgotten before they had been
committed to writing.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>3. The work of the compiler himself is easily traceable.
It is seen in the constantly recurring formulæ,
which come almost like the refrain of an epic poem,
at the accession and close of every reign.</p>

<p>They run normally as follows. For the Kings of
Judah:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And in the ... year of ... King of Israel reigned
... over Judah." "And ... years he reigned in Jerusalem.
And his mother's name was ... the daughter
of.... And ... did that which was {right/evil} in the
sight of the Lord."</p>

<p>"And ... slept with his fathers, and was buried with
his fathers in the City of David his father. And ...
his son reigned in his stead." In the formulæ for the
Kings of Israel "<i>slept with his fathers</i>" is omitted when
the king was murdered; and "<i>was buried with his
fathers</i>" is omitted because there was no unbroken
dynasty and no royal burial-place. The prominent
and frequent mention of the queen-mother is due to
the fact that as <i>Gebira</i> she held a far higher rank than
the favourite wife.</p>

<p>4. To the compiler is also due the moral aspect given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
to the annals and other documents which he utilised.
Something of this religious colouring he doubtless
found in the prophetic histories which he consulted;
and the unity of aim visible throughout the book is due
to the fact that his standpoint is identical with theirs.
Thus, in spite of its compilation from different sources,
the book bears the impress of one hand and of one
mind. Sometimes a passing touch in an earlier narrative
shows the work of an editor after the Exile, as
when in the story of Solomon (1 Kings iv. 20-26) we
read, "And he had dominion over all the region <i>on the
other side of the river</i>," <i>i.e.</i>, west of the Euphrates, exactly
as in Ezra iv. 10. Here the rendering of the A.V., "on
this side the river," is certainly inaccurate, and is surprisingly
retained in the R.V. also.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>5. To this high moral purpose everything else is
subordinated. Like all his Jewish contemporaries, the
writer attaches small importance to accurate chronological
data. He pays little attention to discrepancies,
and does not care in every instance to harmonise his
own authorities.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Some contradictions may be due to
additions made in a later recension,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and some may
have arisen from the introduction of marginal glosses,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
or from corruptions of the text which (apart from a
miraculous supervision such as was not exercised)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
might easily, and indeed would inevitably, occur in
the constant transcription of numerical letters closely
resembling each other. "The numbers as they have
come down to us in the Book of Kings," says Canon
Rawlinson, "are untrustworthy, being in part self-contradictory,
in part opposed to other Scriptural notices,
in part improbable, if not impossible."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>6. The date of the book as it stands was <i>after</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
542, for the last event mentioned in it is the mercy
extended by Evil-merodach, King of Babylon, to his
unfortunate prisoner Jehoiachin (2 Kings xxv. 27) in
the thirty-seventh year of his captivity. The language&mdash;later
than that of Isaiah, and earlier than that of Ezra&mdash;confirms
this conclusion. That the book appeared before
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 536 is clear from the fact that the compiler makes
no allusion to Zerubbabel, Jeshua, or the first exiles
who returned to Jerusalem after the decree of Cyrus.
But it is generally agreed that the book was <i>substantially</i>
complete before the Exile (about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 600),
though some exilic additions may have been made by
a later editor.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> "The writer was already removed by
at least six hundred years from the days of Samuel, a
space of time as long as that which separates us from
the first Parliament of Edward I."</p>

<p>This date of the book&mdash;which cannot but have some
bearing on its historic value&mdash;is admitted by all, since
the peculiarities of the language from the beginning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the end are marked by the usages of later Hebrew.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
The chronicler lived some two centuries later "in
about the same chronological relation to David as
Professor Freeman stands to William Rufus."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>7. Criticism cannot furnish us with the name of this
great compiler.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Jewish tradition, as preserved in the
Talmud,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> assigned the Books of Kings to the prophet
Jeremiah, and in the Jewish canon they are reckoned
among "the earlier prophets." This would account for
the strange silence about Jeremiah in the Second Book
of Kings, whereas he is prominently mentioned in the
Book of Chronicles, in the Apocrypha, and in Josephus.
But unless we accept the late and worthless Jewish
assertion that, after being carried to Egypt by Johanan,
son of Kareah (Jer. xlii. 6, 7), Jeremiah escaped to
Babylon,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> he could not have been the author of the
last section of the book (2 Kings xxv. 27-30).<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Yet
it is precisely in the closing chapters of the second
book (in and after chap. xvii.) that the resemblances
to the style of Jeremiah are most marked.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> That the
writer was a <i>contemporary</i> of that prophet, was closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
akin to him in his religious attitude, and was filled
with the same melancholy feelings, is plain; but this,
as recent critics have pointed out, is due to the fact
that both writers reflect the opinions and the phraseology
which we find in the Book of Deuteronomy.</p>

<p>8. The critics who are so often charged with rash
assumptions have been led to the conclusions which
they adopt by intense and infinite labour, including
the examination of various books of Scripture phrase
by phrase, and even word by word. The sum total of
their most important results as regards the Books of
Kings is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>i. The books are composed of older materials, retouched,
sometimes expanded, and set in a suitable
framework, mostly by a single author who writes
throughout in the same characteristic phraseology, and
judges the actions and characters of the kings from
the standpoint of later centuries. The annals which
he consulted, and in part incorporated, were twofold&mdash;prophetic
and political. The latter were probably
drawn up for each reign by the official recorder (&#1502;&#1463;&#1494;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;),
who held an important place in the courts of all the
greatest kings (2 Sam. viii. 16, xx. 24; 1 Kings iv. 3;
2 Kings xviii. 18), and whose duty it was to write the
"acts" or "words" of the "days" of his sovereign
(&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; &#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;).</p>

<p>ii. The compiler's work is partly of the nature of
an epitome,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and partly consists of longer narratives, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
which we can sometimes trace the Northern Israelitish
origin by peculiarities of form and expression.</p>

<p>iii. The synchronisms which he gives between the
reigns of the kings of Israel and Judah are computed
by himself, or by some redactor, and only in round
numbers.</p>

<p>iv. The speeches, prayers, and prophecies introduced
are perhaps based on tradition, but, since they reflect
all the peculiarities of the compiler, must owe their
ultimate form to him. This accounts for the fact that
the earlier prophecies recorded in these books resemble
the tone and style of Jeremiah, but do not resemble such
ancient prophecies as those of Amos and Hoshea.</p>

<p>v. The numbers which he adopts are sometimes so
enormous as to be grossly improbable; and in these,
as in some of the dates, allowance must be made for
possible errors of tradition and transcription.</p>

<p>vi. "Deuteronomy," says Professor Driver, "is the
standard by which the compiler judges both men and
actions; and the history from the beginning of
Solomon's reign is presented, not in a purely 'objective'
form (as <i>e.g.</i> in 2 Sam. ix.-xx.), but from the
point of view of the Deuteronomic code.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>... The
principles which, in his view, the history as a whole
is to exemplify, are already expressed succinctly in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
charge which he represents David as giving to his son
Solomon (1 Kings ii. 3, 4); they are stated by him
again in chap. iii. 14, and more distinctly in chap. ix.
1-9. Obedience to the Deuteronomic law is the qualification
for an approving verdict; deviation from it is
the source of ill success (1 Kings xi. 9-13, xiv. 7-11,
xvi. 2; 2 Kings xvii. 7-18), and the sure prelude to
condemnation. Every king of the Northern Kingdom is
characterised as doing 'that which was evil in the eyes
of Jehovah.' In the Southern Kingdom the exceptions
are Asa, Jehoshaphat, Jehoash, Amaziah, Uzziah,
Jotham, Hezekiah, Josiah&mdash;usually, however, with the
limitation that 'the high places were not removed' as
demanded by the Deuteronomic law.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The constantly
recurring Deuteronomic phrases which most directly
illustrate the point of view from which the history is
regarded are, '<i>To keep the charge of Jehovah'; 'to
walk in the ways of Jehovah'; 'to keep</i> (or execute)
<i>His commandments, or statutes, and judgments'; 'to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah'; 'to provoke
Jehovah to anger'; 'to cleave to Jehovah</i>.' If the
reader will be at the pains of underlining in his text
the phrases here cited" (and many others of which
Professor Driver gives a list), "he will not only realise
how numerous they are, but also perceive how they
seldom occur indiscriminately in the narrative as such,
but are generally aggregated in particular passages
(mostly comments on the history, or speeches) which
are thereby distinguished from their context, and shown
to be presumably the work of a different hand."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>vii. It must not be imagined that the late compilation
of the book, or its subsequent recensions, or the
dogmatic colouring which it may have insensibly
derived from the religious systems and organisations of
days subsequent to the Exile, have in the least affected
the main historic veracity of the kingly annals. They
may have influenced the omissions and the moral
estimates, but the events themselves are in every case
confirmed when we are able to compare them with
any records and monuments of Ph&#339;nicia, Moab, Egypt,
Assyria, or Babylon. The discovery and deciphering
of the Moabite stone, and of the painted vaunts of
Shishak at Karnak, and of the cuneiform inscriptions,
confirm in every case the general truth, in some
cases the minute details, of the sacred historian. In
so passing an allusion as that in 2 Kings iii. 16, 17
the accuracy of the narrative is confirmed by the fact
that (as Delitzsch has shown) the method of obtaining
water is that which is to this day employed in the
Wady el-Hasa at the southern end of the Dead Sea.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>viii. The Book of Kings consists, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Stade,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of, (<i>a</i>) 1 Kings i., ii., the close of a history of
David, in continuation of 1 and 2 Samuel. The continuity
of the Scriptures is marked in an interesting way
by the word "and," with which so many of the books
begin. The Jews, devout believers in the work of a
Divine Providence, saw no discontinuities in the course
of national events.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) 1 Kings iii.-xi., a conglomerate of notices about
Solomon, grouped round chaps. vi., vii., which narrate
the building of the Temple. They are arranged by the
præ-exilic compiler, but not without later touches from
the Deuteronomic standpoint of a later editor (<i>e.g.</i>,
iii. 2, 3). Chap. viii. 14-ix. 9 also belong to the
later editor.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) 1 Kings xi.-2 Kings xxiii. 29, an epitome of the
entire regal period of Judah and Israel, after the three
first reigns over the undivided kingdom, compiled
mainly before the Exile.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) 2 Kings xxiii. 30-xxv. 30, a conclusion, added,
in its present form, after the Exile.</p>

<p>Two positions are maintained (A) as regards the
text, and (B) as regards the chronology.</p>

<p>A. As regards the <i>text</i> no one will maintain the
old false assertion that it has come down to us in a
perfect condition. There are in the history of the
text three epochs: 1, The Præ-Talmudic; 2, The
Talmudic-Massoretic up to the time when vowel-points
were introduced; 3, The Massoretic traditions of a
later period. The marginal annotations known as
Q'ri, "read" (plural, <i>Qarjan</i>), consist of glosses and
euphemisms which were used in the service of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
synagogue in place of the written text (K'tib); the oral
tradition of these variations was known as the Massora
(<i>i.e.</i>, tradition). The Greek version (Septuagint, LXX.),
which is of immense importance for the history of the
text, was begun in Alexandria under Ptolemy Philadelphus
(<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 283-247). It presents many additions
and variations in the Books of Kings.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>All Hebrew manuscripts, as is well known, are of
comparatively recent date, owing to the strict rule of
the Jewish Schools that any manuscript which had in
the slightest degree suffered from time or use was to be
instantly destroyed. The oldest Hebrew manuscript is
supposed to be the Codex Babylonicus at St. Petersburg
(<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 916), unless one recently discovered by
Dr. Ginsburg in the British Museum be older. Most
Hebrew manuscripts are later than the twelfth century.</p>

<p>The variations in the Samaritan Pentateuch, and in
the Septuagint version&mdash;the latter of which are often
specially valuable as indications of the original text&mdash;furnish
abundant proof that no miracle has been
wrought to preserve the text of Scripture from the
changes and corruptions which always arise in the
course of constant transcriptions.</p>

<p>A further and serious difficulty in the reproduction
of events in their historic exactitude is introduced by
the certainty that many books of the Bible, in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
present form, represent the results arrived at after their
recension by successive editors, some of whom lived
many centuries after the events recorded. In the Books
of Kings we probably see many <i>nuances</i> which were
not introduced till after the epoch-making discovery of
the Book of the Law (perhaps the essential parts of the
Book of Deuteronomy) in the reign of Josiah, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 621
(2 Kings xxii. 8-14). It is, for instance, impossible to
declare with certainty what parts of the Temple service
were really coæval with David and Solomon, and what
parts had arisen in later days. There appear to be
liturgical touches, or alterations as indicated by the
variations of the text in 1 Kings viii. 4, 12, 13. In
xviii. 29-36 the allusion to the <i>Minchah</i> is absent from
the LXX. in verse 36, and in 2 Kings iii. 20 another
reading is suggested.</p>

<p>B. As regards the difficult question of <i>Chronology</i>
we need add but little to what has been elsewhere said.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Even the most conservative critics admit that (1) the
numbers of the Biblical text have often become corrupt
or uncertain; and (2) that the ancient Hebrews were
careless on the subject of exact chronology. The
Chronology of the Kings, as it now stands, is historically
true in its general outlines, but in its details presents
us with data which are mutually irreconcilable. It is
obviously artificial, and is dominated by slight modifications
of the round number 40.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Thus from the Exodus
to the Building of the Temple is stated at 480 years,
and from that period to the fiftieth year of the Exile also
at 480 years. In the Chronicles there are eleven high
priests from Azariah ben-Ahimaaz to the Exile of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Jozadak, which, with the Exile period, gives twelve
generations of 40 years each. Again, from Rehoboam
to the Fall of Samaria in the sixth year of Hezekiah,
following the 40 years' reign of Saul, of David, and of
Solomon, we have:&mdash;</p>

<p>and it can hardly be a mere accident that in these
lists the number 40 is only modified by slight necessary
details.</p>

<p>The history of the Northern Kingdom seems to be
roughly trisected into 80 years before Benhadad's first
invasion, 80 years of Syrian war, 40 years of prosperity
under Jeroboam II., and 40 years of decline.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
This is probably a result of chronological system, not
uninfluenced by mystical considerations. For 480 =
40 × 12. <i>Forty</i> is repeatedly used as a sacred number
in connexion with epochs of penitence and punishment.
<i>Twelve</i> (4 × 3) is, according to Bähr (the chief student
of numerical and other symbolism), "the signature of
the people of Israel"&mdash;as a whole (4), in the midst of
which God (3) resides. Similarly Stade thinks that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
16 is the basal number for the reigns of kings from Jehu
to Hoshea, and 12 from Jeroboam to Jehu.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>It is possible that the synchronistic data did not
proceed from the compiler of the Book of Kings, but
were added by the last redactor.</p>

<p>Are these critical conclusions so formidable? Are
they fraught with disastrous consequences? Which is
really dangerous&mdash;truth laboriously sought for, or error
accepted with unreasoning blindness and maintained
with invincible prejudice?</p>

<h3><i>THE HISTORIAN OF THE KINGS.</i></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"The hearts of kings are in Thy rule and governance, and Thou
dost dispose and turn them as it <i>seemeth best</i> to Thy godly wisdom."</p></blockquote>


<p>Were we to judge the compiler or epitomator of
the Book of Kings from the literary standpoint
of modern historians, he would, no doubt, hold a very
inferior place; but so to judge him would be to take a
mistaken view of his object, and to test his merits and
demerits by conditions which are entirely alien from
the ideal of his contemporaries and the purpose which
he had in view.</p>

<p>It is quite true that he does not even aim at fulfilling
the requirements demanded of an ordinary secular
historian. He does not attempt to present any philosophical
conception of the political events and complicated
interrelations of the Northern and Southern
Kingdoms. His method of writing the story of the
Kings of Judah and Israel in so many separate paragraphs
gives a certain confusedness to the general
picture. It leads inevitably to the repetition of the
same facts in the accounts of two reigns. Each king
is judged from a single point of view, and that not the
point of view by which his own age was influenced,
but one arrived at in later centuries, and under changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
conditions, religious and political. There is no attempt
to show that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"God fulfils Himself in many ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lest one good custom should corrupt the world."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The military splendour or political ability of a king
goes for nothing. It has so little interest for the writer
that a brilliant and powerful ruler like Jeroboam II.
seems to excite in him as little interest as an effeminate
weakling like Ahaziah. He passes over without notice
events of such capital importance as the invasion of
Zerah the Ethiopian (2 Chron. xiv. 9-15, xvi. 8); the
wars of Jehoshaphat against Edom, Ammon, and Moab
(2 Chron. xx. 1-25); of Uzziah against the Philistines
(2 Chron. xxvi. 6-8); and of the Assyrians against
Manasseh (2 Chron. xxxiii. 11-13). He neither tells
us that Omri subdued Moab, nor that he was defeated
by Syria. He scarcely more than mentions events of
such deep interest as the conquest of Jerusalem by
Shishak (1 Kings xiv. 25, 26); the war between Abijam
and Jeroboam (1 Kings xv. 7); of Amaziah with Edom
(2 Kings xiv. 7); or even the expedition of Josiah
against Pharaoh-nechoh (2 Kings xxiii. 29).<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> For these
events he is content to relegate us to the best authorities
which he used, with the phrase "and the rest of
his acts, his wars, and all that he did." The fact that
Omri was the founder of so powerful a dynasty that the
Kings of Israel were known to Assyria as "the House
of Omri," does not induce him to give more than a
passing notice to that king. It did not come within his
province to record such memorable circumstances as
that Ahab fought with the Aramæan host against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Assyria at the battle of Karkar, or that the bloodstained
Jehu had to send a large tribute to Shalmaneser II.</p>

<p>There is a certain monotony in the grounds given
for the moral judgments passed on each successive
monarch. One unchanging formula tells us of every
one of the kings of Israel that "<i>he did that which was
evil in the sight of the Lord</i>," with exclusive reference in
most cases to "the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
wherewith he made Israel to sin." The unfavourable
remark about king after king of Judah that "<i>nevertheless
the high places were not taken away; the people offered
and burnt incense yet in the high places</i>" (1 Kings xv. 14,
xxii. 43; 2 Kings xii. 3, xiv. 4) makes no allowance
for the fact that high places dedicated to Jehovah had
been previously used unblamed by the greatest judges
and seers, and that the feeling against them had only
entered into the national life in later days.</p>

<p>It belongs to the same essential view of history that
the writer's attention is so largely occupied by the activity
of the prophets, whose personality often looms far more
largely on his imagination than that of the kings. If
we were to remove from his pages all that he tells us
of Nathan, Ahijah of Shiloh, Shemaiah, Jehu the son
of Hanani, Elijah, Elisha, Micaiah, Isaiah, Huldah,
Jonah, and various nameless "men of God,"<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> the residuum
would be meagre indeed. The silence as to
Jeremiah is a remarkable circumstance which no theory
has explained; but we must remember the small extent
of the compiler's canvas, and that, even as it is, we
should have but a dim insight into the condition of the
two kingdoms if we did not study also the extant
writings of contemporary prophets. His whole aim is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
to exhibit the course of events as so controlled by the
Divine Hand that faithfulness to God ensured blessing,
and unfaithfulness brought down His displeasure and
led to national decline. So far from concealing this
principle he states it, again and again, in the most
formal manner.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>These might be objections against the author if he
had written his book in the spirit of an ordinary
historian. They cease to have any validity when we
remember that he does not profess to offer us a secular
history at all. His aim and method have been described
as "prophetico-didactic." He writes avowedly as one
who believed in the Theocracy. His epitomes from
the documents which he had before him were made with
a definite religious purpose. The importance or unimportance
of kings in his eyes depended on their relation
to the opinions which had come home to the conscience
of the nation in the still recent reformation of Josiah.
He strove to solve the moral problems of God's government
as they presented themselves, with much distress
and perplexity, to the mind of his nation in the days
of its decadence and threatened obliteration. And in
virtue of his method of dealing with such themes, he
shares with the other historical writers of the Old
Testament a right to be regarded as one of the
<i>Prophetæ priores</i>.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>What were those problems?</p>

<p>They were the old problems respecting God's moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
government of the world which always haunted the
Jewish mind, complicated by the disappointment of
national convictions about the promises of God to the
race of Abraham and the family of David.</p>

<p>The Exile was already imminent&mdash;it had indeed
partly begun in the deportation of Jehoiakin and many
Jews to Babylon (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 598)&mdash;when the book saw the
light. The writer was compelled to look back with
tears on "the days that were no more." The epoch of
Israel's splendour and dominion seemed to have passed
for ever. And yet, was not God the true Governor of
His people? Had He not chosen Jacob for Himself,
and Israel for His own possession? Had not Abraham
received the promise that his seed should be as the
sand of the sea, and that in his seed should all the
nations of the earth be blessed? Or was it a mere
illusion that "when Israel was a child I loved him, and
out of Egypt I called My son"? The writer clung with
unquenchable faith to his convictions about the destinies
of his people, and yet every year seemed to render their
fulfilment more distant and more impossible.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The promise to Abraham had been renewed to Isaac,
and to Jacob, and to the patriarchs; but to David and
his house it had been reiterated with special emphasis
and fresh details. That promise, as it stood recorded
in 2 Sam. vii. 12-16, was doubtless in the writer's
hands. The election of Israel as "God's people" is
"a world-historic fact, the fundamental miracle which
no criticism can explain away."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> And, in addition,
God had sworn in His holiness that He would not
forsake David. "When thy days be fulfilled," He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
said, "and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set
up thy seed after thee ... and will establish his
kingdom. He shall build an house for My name, and
<i>I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever, I will
be his father, and he shall be My son</i>. If he commit
iniquity, I will chastise him with the rod of men, and
with the stripes of the children of men. <i>But My mercy
shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul whom
I put away before thee, and thy house and thy kingdom
shall be established for ever before thee; thy throne shall
be established for ever.</i>" This promise haunted the
imagination of the compiler of the Book of Kings. He
repeatedly refers to it, and it is so constantly present
to his mind that his whole narrative seems to be a
comment, and often a perplexed and half-despairing
comment, upon it.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Yet he resisted the assaults of
despair. The Lord had made a faithful oath unto
David, and He would <i>not</i> depart from it.</p>

<p>It is this that makes him linger so lovingly on the
glories of the reign of Solomon. At first they seem
to inaugurate an era of overwhelming and permanent
prosperity. Because Solomon was the heir of David
whom God had chosen, his dominion is established
without an effort in spite of a formidable conspiracy.
Under his wise, pacific rule the united kingdom springs
to the zenith of its greatness. The writer dwells with
fond regret upon the glories of the Temple, the Empire,
and the Court of the wise king. He records God's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
renewed promises to him that there should not be any
among the kings like unto him all his days. Alas! the
splendid visions had faded away like an unsubstantial
pageant. Glory had led to vice and corruption.
Worldly policy carried apostasy in its train. The sun
of Solomon set in darkness, as the sun of David had
set in decrepitude and blood. "And the Lord was
angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned
from the Lord God of Israel, who had appeared unto
him twice: ... but he kept not that which the Lord
commanded. Wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon,
Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not
kept My covenant, ... I will surely rend the kingdom
from thee.... Notwithstanding in thy day I will not
do it for David thy father's sake.... Howbeit I will not
rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to thy
son, for David My servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's
sake which I have chosen."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Thus at one blow the heir of "Solomon in all his
glory" dwindles into the kinglet of a paltry little
province not nearly so large as the smallest of English
counties. So insignificant, in fact, do the fortunes of
the kingdom become, that, for long periods, it has no
history worth speaking of. The historian is driven to
occupy himself with the northern tribes because they
are the scene of the activity of two glorious though
widely different prophets. From first to last we seem
to hear in the prose of the annalist the cry of the
troubled Psalmist, "Lord, where are Thy old loving-kindnesses
which Thou swarest unto David in Thy
truth? Remember, Lord, the rebukes that Thy servants
have, and how I do bear in my bosom the rebukes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
many people wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed
Thee, and slandered the footsteps of Thine anointed."
And yet, in spite of all, with invincible confidence, he
adds, "Praised be the Lord for evermore. Amen and
Amen."</p>

<p>And this is one of the great lessons which we learn
alike from Scripture and from the experience of every
holy and humble life. It may be briefly summed up
in the words, "Put thou thy trust in God and be doing
good, and He shall bring it to pass." In multitudes
of forms the Bible inculcates upon us the lesson,
"Have faith in God," "Fear not; only believe." The
paradox of the New Testament is the existence of joy
in the midst of sorrow and sighing, of exultation
(&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#8055;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;) even amid the burning fiery furnaces of
anguish and persecution. The secret of both Testaments
alike is the power to maintain an unquenchable
faith, an unbroken peace, an indomitable trust amid
every complication of disaster and apparent overthrow.
The writer of the Book of Kings saw that God is
patient, because He is eternal; that even the histories
of nations, not individual lives only, are but as one
ticking of a clock amid the eternal silence; that God's
ways are not man's ways. And because this is so&mdash;because
God sitteth above the water floods and remaineth
a King for ever&mdash;therefore we can attain to that ultimate
triumph of faith which consists in holding fast our
profession, not only amid all the waves and storms of
calamity, but even when we are brought face to face with
that which wears the aspect of absolute and final failure.
The historian says in the name of his nation what the
saint has so often to say in his own, "Though He slay
me, yet will I trust in Him." Amos, earliest of the
prophets whose written utterances have been preserved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
undazzled by the magnificent revival of the Northern
Kingdom under Jeroboam II., was still convinced that
the future lay with the poor fallen "booth" of David's
royalty: "And I will raise up his ruins, and I will build
it as in the days of old, ... saith the Lord that doeth
this."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> In many a dark age of Jewish affliction this fire
of conviction has still burned amid the ashes of national
hopes after it had seemed to have flickered out under
white heaps of chilly dust.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<h3><i>GOD IN HISTORY.</i></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Lord remaineth a King for ever."</p></blockquote>


<p>Had the compiler of the Book of Kings been so
incompetent and valueless an historian as some
critics have represented, it would indeed have been
strange that his book should have kindled so immortal
an interest, or have taken its place securely in the
Jewish canon among the most sacred books of the
world. He could not have secured this recognition
without real and abiding merits. His greatness appears
by the manner in which he grapples with, and is not
crushed by, the problems presented to him by the course
of events to him so dismal.</p>

<p>1. He wrote after Israel had long been scattered
among the nations. The sons of Jacob had been
deported into strange lands to be hopelessly lost and
absorbed amid heathen peoples. The district which
had been assigned to the Ten Tribes after the conquest
of Joshua had been given over to an alien and mongrel
population. The worst anticipations of northern prophets
like Amos and Hoshea had been terribly fulfilled.
The glory of Samaria had been wiped out, as when
one wipeth a dish, wiping and turning it upside down.
From the beginning of Israel's separate dominion the
prophets saw the germ of its final ruin in what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
called the "calf-worship" of Jeroboam, which prepared
the way for the Baal-worship introduced by the House
of Omri. In the two and a half centuries of Samaria's
existence the compiler of this history finds nothing
of eternal interest except the activity of God's great
messengers. In the history of Judah the better reigns
of a Jehoshaphat, of a Hezekiah, of a Josiah, had shed
a sunset gleam over the waning fortunes of the remnant
of God's people. Hezekiah and Josiah, with whatever
deflections, had both ruled in the theocratic spirit.
They had both inaugurated reforms. The reformation
achieved by the latter was so sweeping and thorough
as to kindle the hope that the deep wound inflicted
on the nation by the manifold crimes of Manasseh
had been healed. But it was not so. The records of
these two best kings end, nevertheless, in prophecies
of doom.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The results of their reforming efforts proved
to be partial and unsatisfactory. A race of vassal
weaklings succeeded. Jehoahaz was taken captive by
the Egyptians, who set up Jehoiakim as their puppet.
He submits to Nebuchadnezzar, attempts a weak revolt,
and is punished. In the short reign of Jehoiachin the
captivity begins, and the futile rebellion of Zedekiah
leads to the deportation of his people, the burning
of the Holy City, and the desecration of the Temple.
It seemed as though the ruin of the olden hopes could
not have been more absolute. Yet the historian will
not abandon them. Clinging to God's promises with
desperate and pathetic tenacity he gilds his last page,
as with one faint sunbeam struggling out of the stormy
darkness of the exile, by narrating how Evil-merodach
released Jehoiachin from his long captivity, and treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
him with kindness, and advanced him to the first rank
among the vassal kings in the court of Babylon. If
the ruler of Judah must be a hopeless prisoner, let
him at least occupy among his fellow-prisoners a sad
pre-eminence!</p>

<p>2. The historian has been blamed for the perpetual
gloom which enwraps his narrative. Surely the
criticism is unjust. He did not invent his story. He
is no whit more gloomy than Thucydides, who had to
record how the brief gleam of Athenian glory sank in
the Bay of Syracuse into a sea of blood. He is not
half so gloomy as Tacitus, who is forced to apologise
for the "hues of earthquake and eclipse" which darken
his every page. The gloom lay in the events of which
he desired to be the faithful recorder. He certainly
did not love gloom. He lingers at disproportionate
length over the grandeur of the reign of Solomon,
dilating fondly upon every element of his magnificence,
and unwilling to tear himself away from the one period
which realised his ideal expectations. After that period
his spirits sink. He cared less to deal with a divided
kingdom of which only the smallest fragment was even
approximately faithful. There could be nothing but
gloom in the record of shortlived, sanguinary, and idolatrous
dynasties, which succeeded each other like the
scenes of a grim phantasmagoria in Samaria and
Jezreel. There could be nothing but gloom in the story
of that northern kingdom in which king after king was
dogged to ruin by the politic unfaithfulness of the rebel
by whom it had been founded. Nor could there be
much real brightness in the story of humiliated Judah.
There also many kings preferred a diplomatic worldliness
to reliance on their true source of strength. Even
in Judah there were kings who defiled God's own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
temple with heathen abominations; and a saint like
Hezekiah had been followed by an apostate like
Manasseh. Had Judah been content to dwell in the
defence of the Most High and abide under the shadow
of the Almighty, she would have been defended under
His wings and been safe beneath His feathers; His
righteousness and truth would have been her shield
and buckler. He who protected her in the awful crisis
of Sennacherib's invasion had proved that He never
faileth them that trust Him. But her kings had preferred
to lean on such a bruised reed as Egypt, which
broke under the weight, and pierced the hand of all
who relied on her assistance. "But ye said, Nay, but
we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and,
We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that
pursue you be swift."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>3. And has not gloom been the normal characteristic
of many a long period of human history? It is with
the life of nations as with the life of men. With
nations, too, there is "a perpetual fading of all beauty
into darkness, and of all strength into dust." Humanity
advances, but it advances over the ruins of peoples and
the wrecks of institutions. Truth forces its way into
acceptance, but its progress is "from scaffold to scaffold,
and from stake to stake." All who have generalised
on the course of history have been forced to recognise
its agonies and disappointments. There, says Byron,</p>

<p>Mr. W. H. Lecky, again, considering the facts of
national story from the point of view of heredity, and

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The voice of the afflicted is rising to the sun,<br /></span>

<p>Or, if we desire a prose authority, can we deny this
painful estimate of Mr. Ruskin?&mdash;"Truly it seems to
me as I gather in my mind the evidence of insane
religion, degraded art, merciless war, sullen toil, detestable
pleasure, and vain or vile hope in which the
nations of the world have lived since first they could
bear record of themselves, it seems to me, I say, as if
the race itself were still half serpent, not extricated yet
from its clay; a lacertine brood of bitterness, the glory
of it emaciate with cruel hunger and blotted with venomous
stain, and the track of it on the leaf a glittering
slime, and in the sand a useless furrow."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Dark as is the story which the author of the Book
of Kings has to record, and hopeless as might seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
be the conclusion of the tragedy, he is responsible for
neither. He can but tell the things that were, and tell
them as they were; the picture is, after all, far less
gloomy than that presented in many a great historic
record. Consider the features of such an age as that
recorded by Tacitus, with the "Iliad of woes" of
which he was the annalist.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Does Jewish history offer
us nothing but this horrible monotony of delations and
suicides? Consider the long ages of darkness and
retrogression in the fifth and following centuries; or
the unutterable miseries inflicted on the seaboard of
Europe by the invasions of the Norsemen&mdash;the mere
thought of which drove Charlemagne to tears; or the
long complicated agony produced by hundreds of petty
feudal wars, and the cruel tyranny of marauding
barons; or the condition of England in the middle of
the fourteenth century when the Black Death swept
away half of her population; or the extreme misery
of the masses after the Thirty Years' War; or the
desolating horror of the wars of Napoleon which filled
Germany with homeless and starving orphans. The
annals of the Hebrew monarchy are less grim than
these; yet the House of Israel might also seem to
have been chosen out for a pre-eminence of sorrow
which ended in making Jerusalem "a rendezvous for
the extermination of the race." When once the Jewish
wars began&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Vengeance! thy fiery wing their race pursued,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thy thirsty poniard blushed with infant blood!<br /></span>

<span class="i1">He saw his sons by dubious slaughter fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And war without, and death within the wall."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Probably no calamity since time began exceeded in
horror and anguish the carnage and cannibalism and
demoniac outbreak of every vile and furious passion
which marked the siege of Jerusalem; and, in the
dreary ages which followed, the world has heard rising
from the Jewish people the groan of myriads of broken
hearts.</p>

<p>"The fruits of the earth have lost their savour,"
wrote one poor Rabbi, the son of Gamaliel, "and no
dew falls."</p>

<p>In the crowded Ghettos of mediæval cities, during
the foul tyranny of the Inquisition in Spain, and many
a time throughout Europe, amid the iron oppression of
ignorant and armed brutality, the hapless Jews have
been forced to cry aloud to the God of their fathers:
"Thou feedest Thy people with the bread of tears, and
givest them plenteousness of tears to drink!" "Thou
sellest Thy people for nought, and givest no money
for them."</p>

<p>When the eccentric Frederic William I. of Prussia
ordered his Court chaplain to give him in one sentence
a proof of Christianity, the chaplain answered without
a moment's hesitation: "The Jews, your Majesty."
Truly it might seem that the fortunes of that strange
people had been designed for a special lesson, not to
them only, but to the whole human race; and the
general outlines of that lesson have never been more
clearly and forcibly indicated than in the Book of
Kings.</p>

<h3><i>HISTORY WITH A PURPOSE.</i></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"History, as distinguished from chronicles or annals, must always
contain a theory whether confessed by the writer or not. A sound
theory is simply a general conception which co-ordinates a multitude
of facts. Without this, facts cease to have interest except to the
antiquarian."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Laurie.</span></p></blockquote>


<p>The prejudice against history written with a
purpose is a groundless prejudice. Herodotus,
Thucydides, Livy, Sallust, had each his guiding principle,
no less than Ammianus Marcellinus, St. Augustine,
Orosius, Bossuet, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Kant, Turgot,
Condorcet, Hegel, Fichte, and every modern historian
worthy the name. They have all, as Mr. Morley says,
felt the intellectual necessity for showing "those secret
dispositions of events which prepared the way for
great changes, as well as the momentous conjunctures
which more immediately brought them to pass."
Orosius, founding his epitome on the hint given by St.
Augustine in his <i>De Civitate Dei</i>, begins with the famous
words, "<i>Divina providentia agitur mundus et homo.</i>"
Other serious writers may vary the formula, but in all
their annals the lesson is essentially the same. "The
foundation upon which, at all periods, Israel's sense of
its national unity rested was religious in its character."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
"The history of Israel," says Stade, "is essentially
a history of religious ideas."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Of course the history is rendered valueless if, in
pursuing his purpose, the writer either falsifies events
or intentionally manipulates them in such a way that
they lead to false issues. But the man who is not
inspired by his subject, the man to whom the history
which he is narrating has no particular significance,
must be a man of dull imagination or cold affections.
No such man can write a true history at all. For
history is the record of what has happened to men in
nations, and its events are swayed by human passions,
and palpitate with human emotions. There is no great
historian who may not be charged with having been
in some respects a partisan. The ebb and flow of his
narrative, the "to-and-fro-conflicting waves" of the
struggles which he records, must be to him as idle as
a dance of puppets if he feels no special interest in the
chief actors, and has not formed a distinct judgment of
the sweep of the great unseen tidal forces by which
they are determined and controlled.</p>

<p>The greatness of the sacred historian of the Kings
consists in his firm grasp of the principle that God is
the controlling power and sin the disturbing force in
the entire history of men and nations.</p>

<p>Surely he does not stand alone in either conviction.
Both propositions are confirmed by all experience.
In all life, individual and national, sin is weakness;
and human life without God, whether isolated or
corporate, is no better than</p>

<p>"Why do the heathen so furiously rage together,"
sang the Psalmist, "and why do the people imagine
a vain thing?... He that dwelleth in the heavens
shall laugh them to scorn; the Lord shall have them

the first lines of the <i>Iliad</i>, declares that amid those
scenes of carnage, and the tragic fate of heroes, &#916;&#953;&#8056;&#962;
&#948;' &#7952;&#964;&#8051;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#949;&#964;&#959; &#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#8053;:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the <i>Odyssey</i> the same conviction is repeated,
where Odysseus says that "it is the fate-fraught decree
of Zeus which stands by as arbiter, when it is meant
that miserable men should suffer many woes."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The
heathen, too, saw clearly that,</p>

<span class="i0">"Though the mills of God grind slowly,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yet they grind exceeding small;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and that, alike for Trojans and Danaans, the chariot-wheels
of Heaven roll onward to their destined goal.</p>

<p>Such words express a belief in the hearts of pagans
identical with that in the hearts of the early disciples
when they exclaimed: "Of a truth in this city against
Thy holy Servant Jesus, whom Thou didst anoint, both
Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the
peoples of Israel, were gathered together, <i>to do whatsoever
Thy hand and Thy counsel foreordained to come to
pass</i>."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>The ever-present intensity of these convictions leads
the historian of the Kings to many shorter or longer
"homiletic excursuses," in which he develops his main
theme. And if he inculcates his high faith in the form
of speeches and other insertions which perhaps express
his own views more distinctly than they could have been
expressed by the earlier prophets and kings of Judah,
he adopts a method which was common in past ages
and has always been conceded to the greatest and most
trustworthy of ancient historians.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<h3><i>LESSONS OF THE HISTORY.</i></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"Great men are the inspired texts of that Divine Book of Revelation
of which a chapter is completed from epoch to epoch, and by some
named History."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Carlyle.</span></p></blockquote>


<p>Thus history becomes one of the most precious
books of God. To speak vaguely of "a stream
of tendency not ourselves which makes for righteousness,"
is to endow "a stream of tendency" with a moral
sense. Philosophers may talk of "dass unbekannte
höhere Wesen das wir ahnen"; but the great majority,
alike of the wisest and the humblest of mankind, will
give to that moral "Not-ourselves" the name of God.
The truth was more simply and more religiously expressed
by the American orator when he said that "One
with God is always in a majority," and "God is the only
final public opinion." Only thus can we account for
the fact that events apparently the most trivial have
repeatedly been overruled to produce the most stupendous
issues, and opposition apparently the most overwhelming
has been made to further the very ends
which it most fiercely resisted. "The fierceness of man
shall turn to Thy praise, and the fierceness of them
shalt Thou restrain."</p>

<p>St. Paul expresses his sense of this fact when he
says, "Not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
not many noble, are called: but God chose the foolish
things of the world, and the weak things of the world,
and the base things of the world, and the things that
are despised did God choose, and the things that are
not, that He might bring to nought the things that
are":<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and that "because the foolishness of God is wiser
than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than
men."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>The most conspicuous instance of these laws in
history is furnished by the victories of Christianity.
It was against all probability that a faith not only
despised but execrated&mdash;a faith whose crucified Messiah
kindled unmitigated contempt, and its doctrine of the
Resurrection unmingled derision&mdash;a faith confined
originally to a handful of ignorant peasants drawn
from the dregs of a tenth-rate and subjugated people&mdash;should
prevail over all the philosophy, and genius, and
ridicule, and authority of the world, supported by the
diadems of all-powerful Cæsars and the swords of thirty
legions. It was against all probability that a faith
which, in the world's judgment, was so abject, should in
so short a space of time achieve so complete a triumph,
not by aggressive force, but by meek non-resistance,
and that it should win its way through armed antagonism
by the sole powers of innocence and of martyrdom&mdash;"not
by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith
the Lord of Hosts."</p>

<p>But though the thoughtful Israelite had no such
glorious spectacle as this before him, he saw something
analogous to it. The prophets had been careful to point
out that no merit or superiority of its own had caused
the people to be chosen by God from among the nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
for the mighty functions for which it was destined,
and which it had already in part fulfilled. "And thou
shalt answer before the Lord thy God, and say, A
Syrian ready to perish was my father; he went down
to Egypt, and sojourned there, few in number."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The
chosen people could boast of no loftier ancestry than
that they sprang from a fugitive from the land of Ur,
whose descendants had sunk into a horde of miserable
slaves in the hot valley of Egypt. Yet from that
degraded and sensuous serfdom God had led them into
the wilderness "through parted seas and thundering
battles," and had spoken to them at Sinai in a voice so
mighty that its echoes have rolled among the nations
for evermore. If through their sins and shortcomings
they had once more been reduced to the rank of captive
strangers in a strange land, the historian knew that
even then their lot was not so abject as it once had
been. They had at least heroic memories and an
imperishable past. He believed that though God's face
was darkened to them, the light of it was neither utterly
nor finally withdrawn. Nothing could henceforth shake
his trust that, even when Israel walked in the valley
of the shadow of death, God would still be with His
people; that "He would <i>love</i> their souls out of the
pit of destruction."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The vain-glorious efforts of the
heathen were foredoomed to final impotence, for God
ruled the raging of the sea, the noise of his waves,
and the madness of the people.</p>

<p>If this high faith seemed so often to lead only to
frustrate hopes, the historian saw the reason. His
philosophy of history reduced itself to the one rule
that "Righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
reproach of any people." It is a sublime philosophy,
and no other is possible. It might be written as the
comment on every history in the world. The prophets
write it large, and again and again, as in letters of
blood and fire. Upon their pages, even from the days
of Balaam,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">"In outline dim and vast<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Their mighty shadows cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The giant forms of Empires on their way<br /></span>
<span class="i6">To ruin: one by one<br /></span>
<span class="i6">They tower, and they are gone!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Balaam had uttered his denunciation on Moab and
Amalek and the Kenite. Amos hurled defiance on
Moab, Ammon, and the Philistines. Isaiah taunted
Egypt with her splendid impotence, and had said of
Babylon: "How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer,
son of the morning!" As the sphere of national life
enlarged, Nahum had poured forth his exultant dirge
over the falling greatness of Assyria; and Ezekiel had
painted the desolation which should come on glorious
Tyre. These great prophets had read upon the palace-walls
of the mightiest kingdoms the burning messages
of doom, because they knew that (to quote the words of a
living historian) "for every false word and unrighteous
deed, for cruelty and oppression, for lust and vanity,
the price has to be paid at last.... Justice and truth
alone endure and live. Injustice and falsehood may be
long-lived, but doomsday comes to them at last."</p>

<p>Has the course of ages at all altered the incidence
of these eternal laws? Do modern kingdoms offer any
exceptions to the universal experience of the past?
Look at Spain. Corrupted by her own vast wealth,
by the confusion of religion with the indolent acceptance
of lies which paraded themselves as catholic orthodoxy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and by the fatal disseverance of religion from the moral
law, she has sunk into decrepitude. Read in the utter
collapse and ruin of her great Armada the inevitable
Nemesis on greed, indolence, and superstition. Look
at modern France. When the inflated bubble of her
arrogance collapsed at Sedan as with a touch, two of
her own writers, certainly not prejudiced in favour of
Christian conclusions&mdash;Ernest Renan and Alexandre
Dumas, <i>fils</i>&mdash;pointed independently to the causes of
her ruin, and found them in her irreligion and her
debauchery. The warnings which they addressed to
their countrymen in that hour of humiliation, on the
sanctity of family life and the eternal obligations of
national righteousness, were identical with those
addressed to the Israelites of old by Amos or Isaiah.
The only difference was that the form in which they
were uttered was modern and came with incomparably
less of impassioned force.</p>

<p>The historian who, six hundred years before Christ,
saw so clearly, and illustrated with such striking conciseness,
the laws of God's moral governance of the
world stands far above the casual censure of those who
judge him by a mistaken standard. We owe him a
debt of the deepest gratitude, not only because he has
preserved for us the national records which might
otherwise have perished, but far more because he has
seen and pointed out their true significance. Imagine
an English writer trying to give a sketch of English
history since the death of Henry VI. in a thin volume
of sixty or seventy octavo pages! Is it conceivable
that even the most gifted and brilliant of our historians
could in so short a space have rendered such a service
as this sacred historian has rendered to all mankind?
Do we owe nothing to the vivid insight which enabled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
him to set so many characters clearly before us with
a few strokes of the pen? It is true that it is the
<i>history</i> which is inspired rather than the <i>record</i> of the
history; but the record itself is of quite exceptional
value. It is true that the prophetic historian and the
scientific historian must be judged by wholly different
canons of criticism; but may not the prophetic historian
be much the greater of the two? By the light
of his histories we can read all histories, and see the
common lesson taught us by the life of nations, as by
the life of individuals&mdash;which is, that obedience to God's
law is the only path of safety, the only condition of
permanence. To fear God and keep His commandments
is the end of the matter, and is the whole duty
of man. To one who follows the guiding clue of these
convictions history becomes "Providence made visible."</p>

<p>Bossuet, like St. Augustine, found the key to all
events in a Divine Will controlling and overruling the
course of human destinies by a constant exercise of
superhuman power. Even Comte "ascribed a hardly
less resistible power to a Providence of his own construction,
directing present events along a groove cut
ever more and more deeply for them by the past." And
Mr. John Morley admits that "whether you accept
Bossuet's theory or Comte's&mdash;whether men be their
own Providence, or no more than instruments or
secondary agents in other hands&mdash;this classification of
either Providence equally deserves study and meditation."</p>

<p>Thus, though the Jews were a small and insignificant
people&mdash;though their kings were mere local sheykhs in
comparison with the Pharaohs, or the kings of Assyria
and Babylon; though they had none of that sense of
beauty which gave immortality to the arts of Greece;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
though their temple was an altogether trivial structure
when compared with the Parthenon or the Serapeum;
though they had no drama which can be distantly compared
with the Oresteia of Æschylus, and no epic which
can be put beside the Iliad or the Nibelungen; though
they had nothing which can be dignified with the name
of a system of Philosophy&mdash;yet their influence on the
human race&mdash;rendered permanent by their literature,
or by that fragment of it which we call "The Books"
as though there were none other in the world worth
speaking of&mdash;has been more powerful than that of all
nations upon the development of humanity. Millions
have known the names of David or Isaiah, who never
so much as heard of Sesostris or of Plato. The influence
of the Hebrew race upon mankind has been a moral
and a religious influence. Leaving Christianity out of
sight&mdash;though Christianity itself was nursed in the
cradle of Judaism, and was the fulfilment of the Messianic
idea which was the most characteristic element
in the ancient religion of the Hebrews&mdash;the history of
Israel is more widely known a million-fold than any
history of any people. Professor Huxley is an unsuspected
witness to this truth. He has declared that he
knows of no other work in the world by the study of
which children could be so much humanised, and made
to feel that each figure in that vast historical procession
fills, like themselves, but a momentary space in
the interval between the two eternities. What other
nation has contributed to the treasure of human thought
elements so immeasurably important as the idea of
monotheism, and the Ten Commandments, and the high
spiritual teaching by which the prophets brought home
to the consciousness of our race the nearness, the holiness,
and the love of God? We do not underrate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
value of Eternal Inspiration in the "richly-variegated
wisdom" which "multifariously and fragmentarily" the
Creator has vouchsafed to man; but the Jews will ever
be the most interesting of nations, chiefly because to
them were entrusted the oracles of God.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<h3><i>DAVID'S DECREPITUDE.</i></h3>

<p class="center">1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> i. 1-4.</p>

<p class="center">"Praise a fair day at night."</p>


<p>The old age of good men is often a beautiful
spectacle. They show us the example of a
mellower wisdom, a larger tolerance, a sweeter temper,
a more unselfish sympathy, a clearer faith. The setting
sun of their bright day tinges even the clouds which
gather round it with softer and more lovely hues.</p>

<p>We cannot say this of David's age. After the
oppressive splendour of his heroic youth and manhood
there was no dewy twilight of honoured peace. We
see him in a somewhat pitiable decrepitude. He was
not really old; the expression of our Authorised Version,
"stricken in years," is literally "entered into days,"
but the Book of Chronicles calls him "old and full of
days."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Josephus says that when he died he was only
seventy years old. He had reigned seven years and
a half in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
At the age of seventy many men are still in full vigour
of strength and intellect, but the conditions of that day
were not favourable to longevity. Solomon does not
seem to have survived his sixtieth year; and it is
doubtful whether any one of the kings of Israel or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Judah&mdash;excepting, strange to say, the wicked Manasseh&mdash;attained
even that moderate age. Threescore years
and ten have always been the allotted space of human
life, and few who long survive that age find that their
strength then is anything but labour and sorrow.</p>

<p>But the decrepitude of David was exceptional. He
was drained of all his vital force. He took to his bed,
but though they heaped clothes upon him he could get
no warmth. "He remained cold amid the torrid heat
of Jerusalem." Then his physicians recommended the
only remedy they knew, to give heat to his chilled and
withered frame. It was the primitive and not ineffectual
remedy&mdash;which was suggested twenty-two centuries
later to the great Frederic Barbarossa&mdash;of contact with
the warmth of a youthful frame.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> So they sought out
the fairest virgin in all the coasts of Israel to act as
the king's nurse, and their choice fell on Abishag, a
maiden of Shunem in Issachar.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> There was no question
of his taking another wife. He had already many
wives and concubines, and what the bed-ridden invalid
required was a strong and youthful nurse to cherish
him. We are surprised at such total failure of life's
forces. But David had lived through a youth of toil
and exposure, of fight and hardship, in the days when
his only home had been the dark and dripping limestone
caves, and he had been hunted like a partridge
on the mountains by the furious jealousy of Saul. The
sun had smitten him by day and the moon by night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
and the chill dews had fallen on him in the midnight
bivouacs among the crags of Engedi. Then had followed
the burdens and cares of royalty with guilty anxieties
and deeds which shook his pulses with wrath and fear.
Coincident with these were the demoralising luxuries
and domestic sensualism of a polygamous palace.
Worst of all, he had sinned against God, and against
light, and against his own conscience. For a time his
moral sense had slumbered, and retribution had been
delayed. But when he awoke from his sensual dream,
the belated punishment burst over him in thunder
and his conscience with outstretched finger and tones
of menace must often have repeated to the murderous
adulterer the doom of Nathan and the stern sentence,
"Thou art the man!" Many a vulgar Eastern tyrant
would hardly have regarded David's sin as a sin at all;
but when such a man as David sins, the fact that he
has been admitted into a holier sanctuary adds deadliness
to the guilt of his sacrilege. True he was forgiven,
but he must have found it terribly hard to forgive
himself. God gave back to him the clean heart, and
renewed a right spirit within him; but the sense of
forgiveness differs from the sweetness of innocence, and
the remission of his sins did not bring with it the
remission of their consequences. From that disastrous
day David was a changed man. It might be said of
him as of the Fallen Spirit:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i23">"His face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep scars of thunder had entrenched, and care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat on his faded cheek."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Nemesis of sin's normal consequences pursued
him to the end. Dark spirits walked in his house.
Joab knew his guilty secrets, and Joab became the
tyrannous master of his destiny. Those guilty secrets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
leaked out, and he lost his charm, his influence, his
popularity among his subjects. He was haunted by
an ever-present sense of shame and humiliation. Joab
was a murderer, and went unpunished; but was not he
too an unpunished murderer? If his enemies cursed
him, he sometimes felt with a sense of despair, "Let
them curse. God hath said unto them, Curse David."
His past carried with it the inevitable deterioration of
his present. In the overwhelming shame and horror
which rent his heart during the rebellion of Absalom,
he must often have felt tempted to the fatalism of
desperation, like that guilty king of Greek tragedy
who, burdened with the curse of his race, was forced
to exclaim,&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Curses in his family, a curse upon his daughter,
a curse upon his sons, a curse upon himself, a curse
upon his people,&mdash;there was scarcely one ingredient
in the cup of human woe which, in consequence of his
own crimes, this unhappy king had not been forced
to taste. Scourges of war, famine, and pestilence&mdash;of
a three years' famine, of a three years' flight before
his enemies, of a three days' pestilence&mdash;he had known
them all. He had suffered with the sufferings of his
subjects, whose trials had been aggravated by his own
transgressions. He had seen his sons following his
own fatal example, and he had felt the worst of all
sufferings in the serpent's tooth of filial ingratitude
agonising a troubled heart and a weakened will. It is
no wonder that David became decrepit before his time.</p>

<p>Yet what a picture does he present of the vanity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of human wishes, of the emptiness of all that men
desire, of the truth which Solon impressed on the
Lydian king that we can call no man happy before his
death! David's youth had been a pastoral idyll; his
manhood an epic of war and chivalry; his premature
age becomes the chronicle of a nursery. What different
pictures are presented to us by David in his sweet
youth and glowing bloom, and David in his unloved
and disgraced decline! We have seen him a beautiful
ruddy boy, summoned from his sheepfolds, with the
wind of the desert on his cheek and its sunlight in his
hair, to kneel before the aged prophet and feel the
hands of consecration laid upon his head. Swift and
strong, his feet like hart's feet, his arms able to bend
a bow of steel, he fights like a good shepherd for his
flock, and single-handed smites the lion and the bear.
His harp and song drive the evil spirit from the
tortured soul of the demoniac king. With a sling and
a stone the boy slays the giant champion, and the
maidens of Israel praise their deliverer with songs and
dances. He becomes the armour-bearer of the king,
the beloved comrade of the king's son, the husband
of the king's daughter. Then indeed he is driven into
imperilled outlawry by the king's envy, and becomes
the captain of a band of freebooters; but his influence
over them, as in our English legends of Robin Hood,
gives something of beneficence to his lawlessness, and
even these wandering years of brigandage are brightened
by tales of his splendid magnanimity. The young
chieftain who had mingled a loyal tenderness and
genial humour with all his wild adventures&mdash;who had
so generously and almost playfully spared the life of
Saul his enemy&mdash;who had protected the flocks and
fields of the churlish Nabal&mdash;who, with the chivalry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
of a Sydney, had poured on the ground the bright
drops of water from the Well of Bethlehem for which
he had thirsted, because they had been won by imperilled
lives&mdash;sprang naturally into the idolised hero and poet
of his people. Then God had taken him from the
sheepfolds, from following the ewes great with young
ones, that he might lead Jacob His people and Israel
His inheritance. Generous to the sad memories of
Saul and Jonathan, generous to the princely Abner,
generous to the weak Ishbosheth, generous to poor lame
Mephibosheth, he had knit all hearts like the heart
of one man to himself, and in successful war had
carried all before him, north and south, and east and
west. He enlarged the borders of his kingdom,
captured the City of Waters, and placed the Moloch-crown
of Rabbah on his head. Then in the mid-flush
of his prosperity, in his pride, fulness of bread, and
abundance of idleness, "the tempting opportunity met
the susceptible disposition," and David forgat God who
had done so great things for him.</p>

<p>The people must have felt how deep was the debt of
gratitude which they owed to him. He had given them
a consciousness of power yet undeveloped; a sense of
the unity of their national life perpetuated by the possession
of a capital which has been famous to all succeeding
ages. To David the nation owed the conquest of the
stronghold of Jebus, and they would feel that "as the
hills stand about Jerusalem so standeth the Lord round
about them that fear Him."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The king who associates
his name with a national capital&mdash;as Nebuchadnezzar
built great Babylon, or Constantine chose Byzantium&mdash;secures
the strongest claim to immortality. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
choice made by David for his capital showed an intuition
as keen as that which has immortalised the fame of
the Macedonian conqueror in the name of Alexandria.
Jerusalem is a city which belongs to all time, and even
under the curse of Turkish rule it has not lost its
undying interest. But David had rendered a still
higher service in giving stability to the national religion.
The prestige of the Ark had been destroyed in the
overwhelming defeat of Israel by the Philistines at
Aphek, when it fell into the hands of the uncircumcised.
After that it had been neglected and half forgotten until
David brought it with songs and dances to God's holy
hill of Zion. Since then every pious Israelite might
rejoice that, as in the Tabernacle of old, God was once
more in the midst of His people. The merely superstitious
might only regard the Ark as a fetish&mdash;the fated
Palladium of the national existence. But to all thoughtful
men the presence of the Ark had a deeper meaning,
for it enshrined the Tables of the Moral Law; and those
broken Tables, and the bending Cherubim which gazed
down upon them, and the blood-sprinkled gold of the
Mercy-Seat were a vivid emblem that God's Will is the
Rule of Righteousness, and that if it be broken the soul
must be reconciled to Him by repentance and forgiveness.
That meaning is beautifully brought out in the
Psalm which says, "Who shall ascend into the hill of
the Lord, or who shall rise up into the holy place?
Even he that hath clean hands and a pure heart: who
hath not lifted up his mind unto vanity, nor sworn to
deceive his neighbour."</p>

<p>To David more than to any man that conviction of
the supremacy of righteousness must have been keenly
present, and for this reason his sin was the less
pardonable. It "tore down the altar of confidence"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
in many hearts. It caused the enemies of the Lord to
blaspheme, and was therefore worthy of a sorer punishment.
And God in His mercy smote, and did not spare.</p>

<p>He sinned: then came earthquake and eclipse. His
earthly life was shipwrecked in that place where two
seas meet&mdash;where the sea of calamity meets the sea of
crime.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Then followed the death of his infant child;
the outrage of Amnon; the blood of the brutal ravisher
shed by his brother's hands; the flight of Absalom;
his insolence, his rebellion, his deadly insult to his
father's household; the long day of flight and shame
and weeping and curses, as David ascended the slope
of Olivet and went down into the Valley of Jordan;
the sanguinary battle; the cruel murder of the beloved
rebel; the insolence of Joab; the heartrending cry,
"O Absalom, my son, my son Absalom; would God I
had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!"</p>

<p>Not even then had David's trials ended. He had
to endure the fierce quarrel between Israel and Judah;
the rebellion of Sheba; the murder of Amasa, which
he dared not punish. He had to sink into the further
sin of pride in numbering the people, and to see the
Angel of the Plague standing with drawn sword over
the threshing-floor of Araunah, while his people&mdash;those
sheep who had not offended&mdash;died around him by
thousands. After such a life he was made to feel that
it was not for blood-stained hands like his to rear the
Temple, though he had said, "I will not suffer mine
eyes to sleep nor mine eyelids to slumber, neither the
temples of my head to take any rest till I find a place
for the tabernacle of the Lord, a habitation for the
mighty God of Jacob." And now we see him surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
by intrigues; alienated from the friends and advisers of
his youth; shivering in his sick-room; attended by his
nurse; feeble, apathetic, the ghost and wreck of all
that he held been, with little left him of his life but
its "glimmerings and decays."</p>

<p>It is an oft-repeated story. Even so we see great
Darius</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Deserted at his utmost need<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By those his former bounty fed;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On the bare ground exposed he lies<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Without a friend to close his eyes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So we see glorious Alexander the Great, dying as
a fool dieth, remorseful, drunken, disappointed, at
Babylon. So we see our great Plantagenet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mighty victor, mighty lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Low on his funeral couch he lies!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No pitying heart, no eye afford<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A tear to grace his obsequies."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So we see Louis XIV., <i>le grand monarque</i>, peevish,
<i>ennuyé</i>, fortunate no longer, an old man of seventy-seven
left in his vast lonely palace with his great-grandson,
a frivolous child of five, and saying to him,
"<i>J'ai trop aime la guerre; ne m'imitez point</i>." So we
see the last great conqueror of modern times, embittering
his dishonoured island-exile by miserable disputes
with Sir Hudson Lowe about etiquette and champagne.
But among all the "sad stories of the deaths of kings"
none ends a purer glory with a more pitiful decline
than the poet-king of Israel, whose songs have been
to so many thousands their delight in the house of
their pilgrimage. Truly David's experience no less
than his own may have added bitterness to the traditional
epitaph of his son on all human glory: "Vanity
of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all
is vanity."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ezek.</span>
xvi. 49.</p></blockquote>


<p>A man does not choose his own destiny; it is
ordained for higher ends than his own personal
happiness. If David could have made his choice, he
might, indeed, have been dazzled by the glittering lure
of royalty; yet he would have been in all probability
happier and nobler had he never risen above the simple
life of his forefathers. Our saintly king in Shakespeare's
tragedy says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My crown is in my heart, not on my head;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor to be seen. My crown is called Content;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And crown it is which seldom kings enjoy."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>David assuredly did not enjoy that crown. After
his establishment at Jerusalem it is doubtful whether
he could count more happy days than Abderrahman
the Magnificent, who recorded that amid a life honoured
in peace and victorious in war he could not number
more than fourteen.</p>

<p>We admire the generous freebooter more than we
admire the powerful king. As time went on he showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
a certain deterioration of character, the inevitable result
of the unnatural conditions to which he had succumbed.
Saul was a king of a very simple type. No pompous
ceremonials separated him from the simple intercourse
of natural kindliness. He did not tower over the
friends of his youth like a Colossus, and look down on
his superiors from the artificial elevation of his inch-high
dignity. "In himself was all his state," and there
was something kinglier in his simple majesty when he
stood under his pomegranate at Migron, with his huge
javelin in his hand, than in</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"The tedious pomp which waits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On princes, when their rich retinue long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of horses led, and grooms besmeared with gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dazzles the crowd, and sets them all agape."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We should not have assumed beforehand that there
was anything in David's character which rendered
external pomp and ceremony attractive to him. But
the inherent flunkeyism of Eastern servility made his
courtiers feed him with adulation, and approach him
with genuflexions. Apparently he could not rise
superior to the slowly corrupting influences of autocracy
which gradually assimilated the court of the once
simple warrior to that of his vulgar compeers on the
neighbouring thrones. There is something startling to
see what a chasm royalty has cleft between him and
the comrades of his adversity, and even the partner of
his guilt who had become his favourite queen. We
see it throughout the story of the last scenes in which
he plays a part. He can only be addressed with periphrases
and in the third person. "Let there be sought
for <i>my lord the king</i> a young virgin; and let her stand
before <i>the king</i>, and let her lie in thy bosom, that <i>my
lord the king</i> may get heat." Bathsheba can only speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
to him in such terms as, "Didst not thou, my lord, O
king, swear unto thy handmaid?" and even she, when
she enters the sick-chamber of his decrepitude, prostrates
herself and does obeisance. Every other word
of her speech is interlarded with "my lord the king,"
and "my lord, O king"; and when she leaves "the
presence" she again bows herself with her face to the
earth, and does reverence to the king<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> with the words,
"May my lord, King David, live for ever." The
anointed dignity of the prophet who had once so boldly
rebuked David's worst crime does not exempt him from
the same ceremonial, and he too goes into the inner
chamber bowing his face before the king to the earth.</p>

<p>Insensibly David must have come to require it all,
and to like it. Yet the unsophisticated instincts of his
more natural youth would surely have revolted from it.
He would have deprecated it as sternly as the Greek
conqueror in the mighty tragedy who hates to walk
to his throne on purple tapestries, and says to his
queen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ope not the mouth to me, nor cry amain<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As at the footstool of a man of the East,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Prone on the ground: so stoop not thou to me;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or, as another has more literally rendered it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">"Nor like some barbarous man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gape thou upon me an earth-grovelling howl."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the royal position of David brought with it a
surer curse than that which follows the extreme exaltation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
of a man above his fellows. It brought with
it the permitted luxury of imaginary necessity for
polygamy, and the man-enervating, woman-degrading
paraphernalia of an Eastern harem. Jesse and Boaz,
in their paternal fields at Bethlehem, had been content
with one wife, and had known the true joys of love
and home. But monogamy was thought unsuitable to
the new grandeur of a despot, and under the curse of
polygamy the joy of love, the peace of home, are
inevitably blighted. In that condition man gives up the
sweetest sources of earthly blessing for the meanest
gratifications of animal sensuousness. Love, when it
is pure and true, gilds the life of man with a joy of
heaven, and fills it with a breath of Paradise. It renders
life more perfect and more noble by the union of two
souls, and fulfils the original purpose of creation. A
home, blessed by life's most natural sanctities, becomes
a saving ark in days of storm.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here Love his golden shafts employs, here lights<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His constant lamp, and waves his purple wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Reigns here and revels."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But in a polygamous household a home is exchanged
for a troubled establishment, and love is carnalised into
a jaded appetite. The Eastern king becomes the slave
of every wandering fancy, and can hardly fail to be a
despiser of womanhood, which he sees only on its
ignoblest side. His home is liable to be torn by mutual
jealousies and subterranean intrigues, and many a foul
and midnight murder has marked, and still marks, the
secret history of Eastern seraglios. The women&mdash;idle,
ignorant, uneducated, degraded, intriguing&mdash;with nothing
to think of but gossip, scandal, spite, and animal
passion; hating each other worst of all, and each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
engaged in the fierce attempt to reign supreme in the
affection which she cannot monopolise&mdash;spend wasted
lives of <i>ennui</i> and slavish degradation. Eunuchs, the
vilest products of the most corrupted civilisation, soon
make their loathly appearance in such courts, and add
the element of morbid and rancorous effeminacy to
the general ferment of corruption. Polygamy, as it
is a contravention of God's original design, enfeebles
the man, degrades the woman, corrupts the slave,
and destroys the home. David introduced it into the
Southern Kingdom, and Ahab into the Northern;&mdash;both
with the most calamitous effects.</p>

<p>Polygamy produces results worse than all the others
upon the children born in such families. Murderous
rivalry often reigns between them, and fraternal affection
is almost unknown. The children inherit the
blood of deteriorated mothers, and the sons of different
wives burn with the mutual animosities of the harem,
under whose shadowing influence they have been
brought up. When Napoleon was asked the greatest
need of France, he answered in the one laconic word,
"<i>Mothers</i>"; and when he was asked the best training
ground for recruits, he said, "<i>The nurseries, of course.</i>"
Much of the manhood of the East shows the taint and
blight which it has inherited from such mothers and
such nurseries as seraglios alone can form.</p>

<p>The darkest elements of a polygamous household
showed themselves in the unhappy family of David.
The children of the various wives and concubines saw
but little of their father during their childish years.
David could only give them a scanty and much-divided
attention when they were brought to him to display
their beauty. They grew up as children, the spoiled
and petted playthings of women and debased attendants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
with nothing to curb their rebellious passions or check
their imperious wills. The little influence over them
which David exercised was unhappily not for good.
He was a man of tender affections. He repeated the
errors of which he might have been warned by the
effects of foolish indulgence on Hophni and Phinehas,
the sons of Eli, and even on the sons of the guide of
his youth, the prophet Samuel. The wild careers of
David's elder sons show that they had inherited his
strong passions and eager ambition, and that in their
case, as well as Adonijah's, he had not displeased
them at any time in saying, "Why hast thou done
so?"</p>

<p>The consequences which followed had been frightful
beyond precedent. David must have learnt by experience
the truth of the exhortation, "Desire not a
multitude of unprofitable children, neither delight in
ungodly sons. Though they multiply, rejoice not in
them, except the fear of the Lord be with them: for
one that is just is better than a thousand; and better
it is to die without children, than to have those that
are ungodly."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>David's eldest son was Amnon, the son of Ahinoam
of Jezreel; his second Daniel or Chileab, son of Abigail,
the wife of Nabal of Carmel; the third Absalom, son
of Maacah, daughter of Talmai, King of Geshur; the
fourth Adonijah, the son of Haggith. Shephatiah and
Ithream were the sons of two other wives, and these
six sons were born to David in Hebron. When he
became king in Jerusalem he had four sons by Bathsheba,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
born after the one that died in his infancy, and
at least nine other sons by various wives, besides his
daughter Tamar, sister of Absalom. He had other
sons by his concubines. Most of these sons are
unknown to fame. Some of them probably died in
childhood. He provided for others by making them
priests.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> His line, down to the days of Jeconiah, was
continued in the descendants of Solomon, and afterwards
in those of the otherwise unknown Nathan.
The elder sons, born to him in the days of his more
fervent youth, became the authors of the tragedies
which laid waste his house. They were youths of
splendid beauty, and, as they bore the proud title of
"the king's sons," they were from their earliest years
encircled by luxury and adulation.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Amnon regarded himself as the heir to the throne,
and his fierce passions brought the first infamy into the
family of David. By the aid of his cousin Jonadab, the
wily son of Shimmeah, the king's brother, he brutally
dishonoured his half-sister Tamar, and then as brutally
drove the unhappy princess from his presence. It was
David's duty to inflict punishment on his shameless
heir, but he weakly condoned the crime. Absalom
dissembled his vengeance for two whole years, and
spoke to his brother neither good nor evil. At the end
of that time he invited David and all the princes to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
joyous sheep-shearing festival at Baal Hazor. David,
as he anticipated, declined the invitation, on the plea
that his presence would burden his son with needless
expense. Then Absalom asked that, as the king could
not honour his festival, at least his brother Amnon, as
the heir to the throne, might be present. David's heart
misgave him, but he could refuse nothing to the youth
whose magnificent and faultless beauty filled him with
an almost doting pride, and Amnon and all the princes
went to the feast. No sooner was Amnon's heart
inflamed with wine, than, at a preconcerted signal,
Absalom's servants fell on him and murdered him. The
feast broke up in tumultuous horror, and in the wild
cry and rumour which arose, the heart of David was
torn with the intelligence that Absalom had murdered
all his brothers. He rent his clothes, and lay weeping
in the dust surrounded by his weeping servants. But
Jonadab assured him that only Amnon had been
murdered in revenge for his unpunished outrage, and
a rush of people along the road, among whom the
princes were visible riding on their mules, confirmed
his words. But the deed was still black enough.
Bathed in tears, and raising the wild cries of Eastern
grief, the band of youthful princes stood round the
father whose incestuous firstborn had thus fallen by a
brother's hand, and the king also and all his servants
"wept greatly with a great weeping."</p>

<p>Absalom fled to his grandfather the King of Geshur;
but his purpose had been doubly accomplished. He
had avenged the shame of his sister, and he was now
himself the eldest son and heir to the throne.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> His
claim was strengthened by the superb physique and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
beautiful hair of which he was so proud, and which won
the hearts both of king and people. Capable, ambitious,
secure of ultimate pardon, the son and the grandson of
a king, he lived for three years at the court of his grandfather.
Then Joab, perceiving that David was consoled
for the death of Amnon, and that his heart was
yearning for his favourite son,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> obtained the intercession
of the wise woman of Tekoah, and got permission
for Absalom to return. But his offence had been
terrible, and to his extreme mortification the king
refused to admit him. Joab, though he had man&#339;uvred
for his return, did not come near him, and twice refused
to visit him when summoned to do so. With characteristic
insolence the young man obtained an interview
by ordering his servants to set fire to Joab's field of
barley. By Joab's request the king once more saw
Absalom, and, as the youth felt sure would be the
case, raised him from the ground, kissed, forgave, and
restored him to favour.</p>

<p>For the favour of his weakly-fond father he cared
little; what he wanted was the throne. His proud
beauty, his royal descent on both sides, fired his
ambition. Eastern peoples are always ready to concede
pre-eminence to splendid men. This had helped to win
the kingdom for stately Saul and ruddy David; for the
Jews, like the Greeks, thought that "loveliness of
person involves the blossoming promises of future
excellence, and is, as it were, a prelude of riper beauty."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
It seemed intolerable to this prince in the zenith of
glorious life that he should be kept out of his royal
inheritance by one whom he described as a useless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
dotard. By his personal fascination, and by base
intrigues against David, founded on the king's imperfect
fulfilment of his duties as judge, "he stole the hearts
of the children of Israel." After four years<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> everything
was ripe for revolt. He found that for some unexplained
reason the tribe of Judah and the old capital of
Hebron were disaffected to David's rule. He got leave
to visit Hebron in pretended fulfilment of a vow, and
so successfully raised the standard of revolt that David,
his family, and his followers had to fly hurriedly from
Jerusalem with bare feet and cheeks bathed in tears
along the road of the Perfumers. Of that long day of
misery&mdash;to the description of which more space is given
in Scripture than to that of any other day except that
of the Crucifixion&mdash;we need not speak, nor of the defeat
of the rebellion. David was saved by the adhesion of
his warrior-corps (the <i>Gibborim</i>) and his mercenaries
(the Krêthi and Plêthi). Absalom's host was routed.
He was in some strange way entangled in the branches
of a tree as he fled on his mule through the forest of
Rephaim.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> As he hung helpless there, Joab, with needless
cruelty, drove three wooden staves through his
body in revenge for his past insolence, leaving his
armour-bearer to despatch the miserable fugitive. To
this day every Jewish child flings a contumelious stone
at the pillar in the King's Dale, which bears the traditional
name of David's Son, the beautiful and bad.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>The days which followed were thickly strewn with
calamities for the rapidly ageing and heart-broken king.
His helpless decline was yet to be shaken by the
attempted usurpation of another bad son.</p>

<h3><i>ADONIJAH'S REBELLION.</i></h3>

<p class="center">1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> i. 5-53.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The king's word hath power; and who may say unto him, What
doest thou?"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Eccles.</span> viii. 4.</p></blockquote>


<p>The fate of Amnon and of Absalom might have
warned the son who was now the eldest, and
who had succeeded to their claims.</p>

<p>Adonijah was the son of Haggith, "the dancer." His
father had piously given him the name, which means
"Jehovah is my Lord." He, too, was "a very goodly
man," treated by David with foolish indulgence, and
humoured in all his wishes. Although the rights of
primogeniture were ill-defined, a king's eldest son,
endowed as Adonijah was, would naturally be looked on
as the heir; and Adonijah was impatient for the great
prize. Following the example of Absalom "he exalted
himself, saying, I will be king," and, as an unmistakable
sign of his intentions, prepared for himself fifty
runners with chariots and horsemen.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> David, unwarned
by the past, or perhaps too ill and secluded to be
aware of what was going on, put no obstacle in his way.
The people in general were tired of David, though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
spell of his name was still great. Adonijah's cause
seemed safe when he had won over Joab, the commander
of the forces, and Abiathar, the chief priest.
But the young man's precipitancy spoiled everything.
David lingered on. It was perhaps a palace-secret
that a strong court-party was in favour of Solomon, and
that David was inclined to leave his kingdom to this
younger son by his favourite wife. So Adonijah, once
more imitating the tactics of Absalom, prepared a great
feast at the Dragon-stone by the Fullers' Well, in the
valley below Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> He sacrificed sheep and fat
oxen and cattle, and invited all the king's fifteen sons,
omitting Solomon, from whom alone he had any rivalry
to fear. To this feast he also invited Joab and Abiathar,
and all the men of Judah, the king's servants, by
which are probably intended "all the captains of the
host" who formed the nucleus of the militia forces.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> At
this feast Adonijah threw off the mask. In open rebellion
against David, his followers shouted, "God save
king Adonijah!"</p>

<p>The watchful eye of one man&mdash;the old prophet-statesman,
Nathan&mdash;saw the danger. Adonijah was thirty-five;
Solomon was comparatively a child. "Solomon,
my son," says David, "is young and tender."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> What
his age was at the date of Adonijah's rebellion we do
not know. Josephus says that he was only twelve,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and this would well accord with the fact that he seems
to have taken no step on his own behalf, while Nathan
and Bathsheba act for him. It accords less well with
the calm magnanimity and regal decisiveness which he
displayed from the first day that he was seated on the
throne. The Greek proverb says, &#7944;&#961;&#967;&#8052; &#7940;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#945; &#948;&#949;&#8055;&#954;&#957;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;,
"Power shows the man." Perhaps Solomon, hitherto
concealed in the seclusion of the harem, was, up to this
time, ignorant of himself as well as unknown to the
people. Being unaware of the boy's capacity, many
were taken in by the more showy gifts of the handsome
Adonijah, whose age might seem to promise greater
stability to the kingdom.</p>

<p>But Solomon from his birth upwards had been
Nathan's special charge.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> No sooner had he been
born than David had entrusted the infant to the care
of the man who had awakened his slumbering conscience
to the heinousness of his offence, and had prophesied
his punishment in the death of the child of adultery.
An oracle had forbidden him to build the Temple
because his hands were stained with blood, but had
promised him a son who should be a man of rest, and
in whose days Israel should have peace and quietness.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
Long before, in Hebron, David, yearning for peace, had
called his eldest son Absalom ("the father of peace").
To the second son of Bathsheba, whom he regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
as the heir of oracular promise, he gave the sounding
name of Shel&#333;moh ("the Peaceful").<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> But Nathan,
perhaps with reference to David's own name of "the
Beloved," had called the child Jedidiah ("the beloved
of Jehovah").</p>

<p>The secret of his destiny was probably known to
few, though it was evidently suspected by Adonijah.
To have proclaimed it in a crowded harem would have
been to expose the child to the perils of poison, and to
have doomed him to certain death if one of his unruly
brothers succeeded in seizing the royal authority. The
oath to Bathsheba that her son should succeed must
have been a secret known at the time to Nathan only.
It is evident that David had never taken any step to
secure its fulfilment.</p>

<p>The crisis was one of extreme peril. Nathan was
now old. He had perhaps sunk into the courtly complaisance
which, content with one bold rebuke, ceased
to deal faithfully with David. He had at any rate left
it to Gad the Seer to reprove him for numbering the
people. Now, however, he rose to the occasion, and by
a prompt <i>coup d'état</i> caused the instant collapse of
Adonijah's conspiracy.</p>

<p>Adonijah had counted on the jealousy of the tribe of
Judah, on the king's seclusion and waning popularity,
on the support of "all the captains of the host," on the
acquiescence of all the other princes, and above all on
the favour of the ecclesiastical and military power of
the kingdom as represented by Abiathar and Joab. To
Solomon himself, as yet a shadowy figure and so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
younger, he attached no importance. He treated his
aged father as a cipher, and Nathan as of no particular
account.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> He overlooked the influence of Bathsheba,
the prestige which attached to the nomination of a
reigning king, and above all the resistance of the body-guard
of mercenaries and their captain Benaiah.</p>

<p>Nathan had no sooner received tidings of what was
going on at Adonijah's feast than he shook off his
lethargy and hurried to Bathsheba. She seems to
have retained the same sort of influence over David
that Madame de Maintenon exercised over the aged
Louis XIV. "Had she heard," asked Nathan, "that
Adonijah's coronation was going on at that moment?
Let her hurry to King David, and inquire whether
he had given any sanction to proceedings which contravened
the oath which he had given her that her son
Solomon should be his heir." As soon as she had
broken the intelligence to the king, he would come
and confirm her words.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Bathsheba did not lose a moment. She knew that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Adonijah's conspiracy succeeded her own life and that
of her son might not be worth a day's purchase. The
helplessness of David's condition is shown by the fact
that she had to make her way into "the inner chamber"
to visit him. In violation of the immemorial etiquette
of an Eastern household, she spoke to him without
being summoned, and in the presence of another
woman, Abishag, his fair young nurse. With profound
obeisances she entered, and told the poor old hero that
Adonijah had practically usurped the throne, but that
the eyes of all Israel were awaiting his decision as to
who should be his successor. She asked whether he
was really indifferent to the peril of herself and of
Solomon, for Adonijah's success would mean their
doom.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>While she yet spoke Nathan was announced, as had
been concerted between them, and he repeated the
story of what was going on at Adonijah's feast. It is
remarkable that he says nothing to David either about
consulting the Urim, or in any way ascertaining the
will of God. He and Bathsheba rely exclusively on
four motives&mdash;David's rights of nomination, his promise,
the danger to Solomon, and the contempt shown in
Adonijah's proceedings. "The whole incident," says
Reuss, "is swayed by the ordinary movements of
passion and interest."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The news woke in David a
flash of his old energy. With instant decision he summoned
Bathsheba, who, as custom required, had left
the chamber when Nathan entered. Using his strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
and favourite adjuration, "As the Lord liveth, that hath
redeemed my soul out of all distress,"<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> he pledged
himself to carry out that very day the oath that
Solomon should be his heir. She bowed her face to
the earth in adoration with the words, "Let my lord,
King David, live for ever." He then summoned Zadok,
the second priest, Nathan, and Benaiah, and told them
what to do. They were to take the body-guard<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> which
was under Benaiah's command, to place Solomon on
the king's own she-mule<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> (which was regarded as the
highest honour of all honours), to conduct him down
the Valley of Jehoshaphat to Gihon,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> where the pool
would furnish the water for the customary ablutions,
to anoint him king, and then to blow the consecrated
ram's horn (<i>shophar</i>)<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> with the shout, "God save King
Solomon!" After this the boy was to be seated on
the throne, and proclaimed ruler over Israel and
Judah.</p>

<p>Benaiah was one of David's twelve chosen captains,
who was placed at the head of one of the monthly
courses of 24,000 soldiers in the third month. The
chronicler calls him a priest.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> His available forces
made him master of the situation, and he joyfully
accepted the commission with, "Amen! So may
Jehovah say!" and with the prayer that the throne
of Solomon might be even greater than the throne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
of David. Joab was commander-in-chief of the army,
but his forces had not been summoned or mobilised.
Accustomed to a bygone state of things he had failed
to observe that Benaiah's palace-regiment of six hundred
picked men could strike a blow long before he was
ready for action. These guards were the Krêthi and
Plêthi,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> "executioners and runners," perhaps an alien
body of faithful mercenaries originally composed of
Cretans and Philistines. They formed a compact body
of defenders, always prepared for action. They resemble
the Germans of the Roman Emperors, the Turkish
Janissaries, the Egyptian Mamelukes, the Byzantian
Varangians, or the Swiss Guard of the Bourbons.
Their one duty was to be ready at a moment's notice
to carry out the king's behests. Such a picked regiment
has often held in its hands the prerogative of
Empire. They were, originally at any rate, identical
with the <i>Gibborim</i>,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and had been at first commanded
by men who had earned rank by personal prowess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
But for their intervention on this occasion Adonijah
would have become king.</p>

<p>While Adonijah's followers were wasting time over
their turbulent banquet, the younger court-party were
carrying out the unexpectedly vigorous suggestions of
the aged king. While the eastern hills echoed with
"Long live King Adonijah!" the western hills resounded
with shouts of "Long live King Solomon!"
The young Solomon had been ceremoniously mounted
on the king's mule, and the procession had gone down
to Gihon. There, with the solemnity which is only
mentioned in cases of disputed succession,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Nathan the
prophet and Zadok as priest anointed the son of
Bathsheba with the horn of perfumed oil which the
latter had taken from the sacred tent at Zion.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> These
measures had been neglected by Adonijah's party in
the precipitation of their plot, and they were regarded
as of the utmost importance, as they are in Persia to
this day.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Then the trumpets blew, and the vast
crowd which had assembled shouted, "God save King
Solomon!" The people broke into acclamations, and
danced, and played on pipes, and the earth rang again
with the mighty sound.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Adonijah had fancied, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
he subsequently asserted, that "all Israel set their
faces on me that I should reign." But his vanity had
misled him. Many of the people may have seen
through his shallow character, and may have dreaded
the rule of such a king. Others were still attached to
David, and were prepared to accept his choice. Others
were struck with the grave bearing and the youthful
beauty of the son of Bathsheba. The multitude were
probably opportunists ready to shout with the winner
whoever he might be.</p>

<p>The old warrior Joab, perhaps less dazed with wine
and enthusiasm than the other guests of Adonijah, was
the first to catch the sound of the trumpet blasts and
of the general rejoicing, and to portend its significance.
As he started up in surprise the guests caught sight
of Jonathan, son of Abiathar, a swift-footed priest who
had acted as a spy for David in Jerusalem at Absalom's
rebellion,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> but who now, like his father Abiathar and
so many of his betters, had gone over to Adonijah.
The prince welcomed him as a "man of worth," one
who was sure to bring tidings of good omen;<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> but
Jonathan burst out with, "Nay, but our Lord king
David hath made Solomon king." He does not seem
to have been in a hurry to bring this fatal intelligence;
for he had not only waited until the entire ceremony
at Gihon was over, but to the close of the enthronisation
of Solomon in Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> He had seen the young
king seated on the throne of state in the midst of the
jubilant people. David had been carried out upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
couch, and, bowing his head in worship before the
multitude, had said, "Blessed be the Lord God of
Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this
day, mine eyes even seeing it."</p>

<p>This intelligence fell like a thunderbolt among
Adonijah's unprepared adherents. A general flight
took place, each man being only eager to save himself.
The straw fire of their enthusiasm had already flared
itself away. Deserted by every one, and fearing to
pay the forfeit of his life, Adonijah fled to the nearest
sanctuary, where the Ark stood on Mount Zion under
the care of his supporter the high priest Abiathar.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
There he caught hold of the horns of the altar&mdash;wooden
projections at each of its corners, overlaid with brass.
When a sacrifice was offered the animal was tied to
these horns of the altar,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and they were smeared with
the victim's blood just as in after days the propitiatory
was sprinkled with the blood of the bull and the goat
on the Great Day of Atonement. The mercy-seat thus
became a symbol of atonement, and an appeal to God
that He would forgive the sinful priest and the sinful
nation who came before Him with the blood of expiation.
The mercy-seat would have furnished an inviolable
sanctuary had it not been enclosed in the Holiest Place,
unapproachable by any feet but that of the high priest
once a year. The horns of the altar were, however,
available for refuge to any offender, and their protection
involved an appeal to the mercy of man as to the mercy
of God.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>There in wretched plight clung the fallen prince,
hurled down in one day from the summit of his ambition.
He refused to leave the spot unless King Solomon
would first of all swear that he would not slay his
servant with the sword.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Adonijah saw that all was
over with his cause. "God," says the Portuguese
proverb, "can write straight on crooked lines;" and
as is so often the case, the crisis which brought about
His will was the immediate result of an endeavour to
defeat it.</p>

<p>Solomon was not one of those Eastern princes who</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bear like the Turk no brother near the throne."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Many an Eastern king has begun his reign as Baasha,
Jehu, and Athaliah did, by the exile, imprisonment, or
execution of every possible rival. Adonijah, caught
red-handed in an attempt at rebellion, might have been
left with some show of justice to starve at the horns of
the altar, or to leave his refuge and face the penalty
due to crime. But Solomon, unregarded and unknown
as he had hitherto been, rose at once to the requirements
of his new position, and magnanimously promised
his brother a complete amnesty<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> so long as he remained
faithful to his allegiance. Adonijah descended the steps
of the altar, and having made sacred obeisance to his
new sovereign<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> was dismissed with the laconic order,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
"Go to thine house." If, as some have conjectured,
Adonijah had once urged on his father the condign
punishment of Absalom, he might well congratulate
himself on receiving pardon.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<h3><i>DAVID'S DEATH-BED.</i></h3>

<p class="center">1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> ii. 1-11.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Omnibus idem exitus est, sed et idem domicilium."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Petron.</span>,
<i>Satyr.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>In the Book of Samuel we have the last words of
David in the form of a brief and vivid psalm, of
which the leading principle is, "He that ruleth over
men must be just, ruling in the fear of God." A king's
justice must be shown alike in his gracious influence
upon the good and his stern justice to the wicked. The
worthless sons of Belial are, he says, "to be beaten
down like thorns with spear-shafts and iron."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>The same principle dominates in the charge which
he gave to Solomon, perhaps after the magnificent
public inauguration of his reign described in 1 Chron.
xxviii., xxix. He bade his young son to show himself
a man, and be rigidly faithful to the law of Moses,
earning thereby the prosperity which would never fail
to attend true righteousness.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Thus would the promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
to David&mdash;"There shall not fail thee a man on the throne
of Israel"&mdash;be continued in the time of Solomon.</p>

<p>With our Western and Christian views of morality
we should have rejoiced if David's charge to his son
had ended there. It is painful to us to read that his
last injunctions bore upon the punishment of Joab who
had so long fought for him, and of Shimei whom he
had publicly pardoned. Between these two stern injunctions
came the request that he would show kindness to
the sons of Barzillai,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> the old Gileadite sheykh who had
extended such conspicuous hospitality to himself and
his weary followers when they crossed the Jordan in
their flight from Absalom. But the last words of
David, as here recorded, are: "his (Shimei's) hoar
head bring thou down to the grave with blood."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>In these avenging behests there was nothing which
was regarded as unnatural, nothing that would have
shocked the conscience of the age. The fact that they
are recorded without blame by an admiring historiographer
shows that we are reading the annals of times
of ignorance which God "winked at." They belong to
the era of imperfect moral development, when it was
said to them of old time, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour
and hate thine enemy," and men had not fully
learnt the lesson, "Vengeance is Mine; I will repay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
saith the Lord." We must discriminate between the
<i>vitia temporis</i> and the <i>vitia hominis</i>. David was trained
in the old traditions of the "avenger of blood"; and we
cannot be astonished, though we may greatly regret,
that his standard was indefinitely below that of the
Sermon on the Mount. He may have been concerned
for the safety of his son, but to us it must remain a
proof of his imperfect moral attainments that he bade
Solomon look out for pretexts to "smite the hoary head
of inveterate wickedness," and use his wisdom not to
let the two offenders go down to the grave in peace.</p>

<p>The character of Joab furnishes us with a singular
study. He, Abishai, and Asahel were the brave,
impetuous sons of Zeruiah, the sister or half-sister of
David. They were about his own age, and it is not
impossible that they were the grandsons of Nahash, King
of Ammon.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> In the days of Saul they had embraced
the cause of David, heart and soul. They had endured
all the hardships and fought through all the struggles
of his freebooting days. Asahel, the youngest, had
been in the front rank of his <i>Gibborim</i>, and his foot
was fleet as that of a gazelle upon the mountain.
Abishai had been one of the three who, with jeopardy
of their lives, had burst their way to Bethlehem when
David longed to drink of the water of its well beside
the gate. He had also, on one occasion, saved David's
life from the giant Ishbi of Gath, and had slain three
hundred Philistines with his spear. His zeal was
always ready to flash into action in his uncle's cause.
Joab had been David's commander-in-chief for forty
years. It was Joab who had conquered the Ammonites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and Moabites and stormed the City of Waters. It was
Joab who, at David's bare request, had brought about
the murder of Uriah. It was Joab who, after wise
but fruitless remonstrance, had been forced to number
the people. But David had never liked these rough
imperious soldiers, whose ways were not his ways.
From the first he was unable to cope with them, or
keep them in order. In the early days they had treated
him with rude familiarity, though in late years they,
too, were obliged to approach him with all the forms of
Eastern servility. But ever since the murder of Uriah,
Joab knew that David's reputation and David's throne
were in his hand. Joab himself had been guilty of two
wild acts of vengeance for which he would have offered
some defence, and of one atrocious crime. His murder
of the princely Abner, the son of Ner, might have been
excused as the duty of an avenger of blood, for Abner,
with one back-thrust of his mighty spear, had killed
the young Asahel, after the vain warning to desist
from pursuing him. Abner had only killed Asahel in
self-defence; but, jealous of Abner's power as the
cousin of King Saul, the husband of Rizpah, and the
commander of the northern army, Joab, after bluntly
rebuking David for receiving him, had without hesitation
deluded Abner back to Hebron by a false message
and treacherously murdered him. Even at that early
period of his reign David was either unable or unwilling
to punish the outrage, though he ostentatiously
deplored it.</p>

<p>Doubtless in slaying Absalom, in spite of the king's
entreaty, Joab had inflicted an agonising wound on the
pride and tenderness of his master. But Absalom was
in open rebellion, and Joab may have held that David's
probable pardon of the beautiful rebel would be both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
weak and fatal. This death was inflicted in a manner
needlessly cruel, but might have been excused as a
death inflicted on the battle-field, though probably Joab
had many an old grudge to pay off besides the burning
of his barley field. After Absalom's rebellion David
foolishly and unjustly offered the commandership of the
army to his nephew Amasa. Amasa was the son of
his sister Abigail by an Ishmaelite father, named Jether.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
Joab simply would not tolerate being superseded in the
command which he had earned by lifelong and perilous
services. With deadly treachery, in which men have
seen the antitype of the world's worst crime, Joab
invited his kinsman to embrace him, and drove his
sword into his bowels. David had heard, or perhaps
had seen, the revolting spectacle which Joab presented,
with the blood of war shed in peace, dyeing his girdle
and streaming down to his shoes with its horrible
crimson. Yet, even by that act, Joab had once more
saved David's tottering throne. The Benjamite Sheba,
son of Bichri, was making head in a terrible revolt, in
which he had largely enlisted the sympathy of the
northern tribes, offended by the overbearing fierceness
of the men of Judah. Amasa had been either incompetent
or half-hearted in suppressing this dangerous
rising. It had only collapsed when the army welcomed
back the strong hand of Joab. But whatever had been
the crimes of Joab they had been condoned. David, on
more than one occasion, had helplessly cried, "What
have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah?" "I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
this day weak though anointed king, and these men,
the sons of Zeruiah, are too hard for me." But he
had done nothing, and, whether with or against his
will, they continued to hold their offices near his person.
David did not remind Solomon of the murder of
Absalom, nor of the words of menace&mdash;words as bold
as any subject ever uttered to his sovereign&mdash;with
which Joab had imperiously hushed his wail over his
worthless son. Those words had openly warned the
king that, if he did not alter his line of conduct, he
should be king no more. They were an insult which
no king could pardon, even if he were powerless to
avenge. But Joab, like David himself, was now an old
man. The events of the last few days had shown that
his power and influence were gone. He may have had
something to fear from Bathsheba as the wife of Uriah
and the granddaughter of Ahithophel; but his adhesion
to the cause of Adonijah had doubtless been chiefly
due to jealousy of the ever-growing influence of the
priestly soldier Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, who had
so evidently superseded him in his master's favour.
However that may be, the historian faithfully records
that David, on his death-bed, neither forgot nor forgave;
and all that we can say is, that it would be
unfair to judge him by modern or by Christian principles
of conduct.</p>

<p>The other victim whose doom was bequeathed to the
new king was Shimei, the son of Gera. He had cursed
David at Bahurim on the day of his flight, and in the
hour of his extremest humiliation. He had walked on
the opposite side of the valley, flinging stones and dust
at David,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> cursing him with a grievous curse as a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
of Belial and a man of blood, and telling him that the
loss of his kingdom was the retribution which had fallen
upon him for the blood of the House of Saul which he
had shed. So grievous was the trial of these insults
that the place where the king and his people rested
that night received the pathetic name of <i>Ayephim</i>, "the
place of the weary."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> For this conduct Shimei might
have pleaded the pent-up animosities of the House
of Saul, which had been stripped by David of all its
honours, and of which poor lame Mephibosheth was
the only scion left, after David had impaled Saul's
seven sons and grandsons in human sacrifice at the
demand of the Gibeonites. Abishai, indignant at
Shimei's conduct, had said, "Why should this dead
dog curse my lord the king?" and had offered, then
and there, to cross the valley and take his head. But
David rebuked his generous wrath, and when Shimei
came out to meet him on his return with expressions
of penitence, David not only promised but swore that
he should not die. No further danger surely could be
anticipated from the ruined and humiliated House of
Saul; yet David bade Solomon to find some excuse
for putting Shimei to death.</p>

<p>How are we to deal with sins which are recorded of
God's olden saints on the sacred page, and recorded
without a word of blame?</p>

<p>Clearly we must avoid two errors&mdash;the one of injustice,
the other of dishonesty.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<p>1. On the one hand, as we have said, we must not
judge Abraham, or Jacob, or Gideon, or Jael, or David,
as though they were nineteenth-century Christians.
Christ Himself taught us that some things inherently
undesirable were yet permitted in old days because
of the hardness of men's hearts; and that the moral
standards of the days of ignorance were tolerated in
all their imperfection until men were able to judge of
their own deeds in a purer light. "The times of
ignorance God overlooked," says St. Paul, "but now
He commandeth men that they should all everywhere
repent."<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> "Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt
love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But <i>I say
unto you, Love your enemies</i>," said our Lord.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> When
Bayle and Tindal and many others declaim against
"the immorality of the Bible" they are unfair in a high
degree. They pass judgment on men who had been
trained from infancy in opinions and customs wholly
unlike our own, and whose conscience would not be
wounded by many things which we have been rightly
taught to regard as evil. They apply the enlightenment
of two millenniums of Christianity to criticise the
more rudimentary conditions of life a millennium before
Christ. The wild justice inflicted by an avenger of
blood, the rude atrocity of the <i>lex talionis</i>, are rightly
abhorrent to us in days of civilisation and settled law:
they were the only available means of restraining crime
in unsettled times and half-civilised communities. In
his final injunctions about his enemies, whom he might
have dreaded as enemies too formidable for his son to
keep in subjection, David may have followed the view
of his day that his former condonations had only been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
co-extensive with his own life, and that the claims of
justice <i>ought</i> to be satisfied.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>2. But while we admit every palliation, and endeavour
to judge justly, we must not fall into the conventionality
of representing David's unforgiving severity
as otherwise than reprehensible <i>in itself</i>. Attempts to
gloss over moral wrong-doing, to represent it as blameless,
to invent supposed Divine sanctions and intuitions
in defence of it, can but weaken the eternal claims of
the law of righteousness. The rule of right is inflexible:
it is not a leaden rule which can be twisted into any
shape we like. A crime is none the less a crime
though a saint commits it; and imperfect conceptions
of the high claims of the moral law, as Christ expounded
its Divine significance, do not cease to be imperfect
though they may be sometimes recorded without comment
on the page of Scripture. No religious opinion
can be more fatal to true religion than that wrong can,
under any circumstances, become right, or that we
may do evil that good may come. Because an act
is relatively pardonable, it does not follow that it is
not absolutely wrong. If it be dangerous to judge
the essential morality of any earlier passage of Scripture
by the ultimate laws which Scripture itself has taught
us, it is infinitely more dangerous, and essentially
Jesuitical, to explain away misdeeds as though, under
any circumstances, they could be pleasing to God or
worthy of a saint. The total omission of David's
injunctions and of the sanguinary episodes of their
fulfilment by the author of the Books of Chronicles,
indicates that, in later days, they were thought derogatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
to the pure fame both of the warrior-king and
of his peaceful son.</p>

<p>David slept with his fathers, and passed before that
bar where all is judged of truly. His life is an April
day, half sunshine and half gloom. His sins were
great, but his penitence was deep, lifelong, and sincere.
He gave occasion for the enemies of God to blaspheme,
but he also taught all who love God to praise and pray.
If his record contains some dark passages, and his
character shows many inconsistencies, we can never
forget his courage, his flashes of nobleness, his intense
spirituality whenever he was true to his better self.
His name is a beacon-light of warning against the
glamour and strength of evil passions. But he showed
us also what repentance can do, and we are sure that
his sins were forgiven him because he turned away
from his wickedness. "The sacrifices of God are a
troubled spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God,
Thou wilt not despise." "I go the way of all the
earth," said David. "In life," says Calmet, "each one
has his particular route: one applies to one thing,
another to another. But in the way to death they are
all re-united. They go to the tomb by one path."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>David was buried in his own city&mdash;the stronghold
of Zion; and his sepulchre&mdash;on the south part of Ophel,
near the pool of Siloam&mdash;was still pointed out a thousand
years later in the days of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> As a poet who had
given to the people splendid specimens of lyric songs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
as a warrior who had inspired their youth with dauntless
courage; as a king who had made Israel a united
nation with an impregnable capital, and had uplifted
it from insignificance into importance; as the man in
whose family the distinctive Messianic hopes of the
Hebrews were centred, he must remain to the end
of time the most remarkable and interesting figure
in the long annals of the Old Dispensation.</p>

<p>The reign of Solomon began with a threefold deed
of blood. An Eastern king, surrounded by the
many princes of a polygamous family, and liable to
endless jealousies and plots, is always in a condition of
unstable equilibrium; the <i>death</i> of a rival is regarded
as his only safe imprisonment.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> On the other hand, it
must be remembered that Solomon allowed his other
brethren and kinsmen to live; and, in point of fact, his
younger brother Nathan became the ancestor of the
Divine Messiah of his race.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>It was the restless ambition of Adonijah which again
brought down an avalanche of ruin. He and his
adherents were necessarily under the cold shadow of
royal disfavour, and they must have known that they had
sinned too deeply to be forgiven. They felt the position
intolerable. "In the light of the king's countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
is life, and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain";
but Adonijah, in the prime of strength and the heyday
of passion, beautiful and strong, and once the favourite
of his father, could not forget the banquet at which all
the princes and nobles and soldiers had shouted, "Long
live King Adonijah!" That the royalty of one delirious
day should be succeeded by the dull and suspected
obscurity of dreary years was more than he could
endure, if, by any possible subtlety or force, he could
avert a doom so unlike his former golden dreams.
Was not Solomon at least ten or fifteen years younger
than himself? Was not his seat on the throne of his
kingdom still insecure? Were not his own followers
powerful and numerous?</p>

<p>Perhaps one of those followers&mdash;the experienced Joab,
or Jonathan, son of Abiathar&mdash;whispered to him that he
need not yet acquiesce in the ruin of his hopes, and
suggested a subtle method of strengthening his cause,
and keeping his claim before the eyes of the people.</p>

<p>Every one knew that Abishag, the fair damsel of
Shunem, the ideal of Hebrew maidenhood, was the
loveliest virgin who could be found throughout all the
land of Israel. Had she been in the strict sense David's
wife or concubine, it would have been regarded as a
deadly contravention of the Mosaic law that she should
be wedded to one of her stepsons. But as she had
only been David's nurse, what could be more suitable
than that so bright a maiden should be united to the
handsome prince?</p>

<p>It was understood in all Eastern monarchies that the
harem of a predecessor belonged to the succeeding
sovereign. The first thing that a rival or a usurper
aimed at was to win the prestige of possessing the
wives of the royal house. Nathan reminds David that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the Lord had given his master's wives into his bosom.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
Ishbosheth, weak as he was, had been stung into indignation
against his general and great-uncle the mighty
Abner, because Abner had taken Rizpah, the daughter
of Aiah, Saul's concubine, to wife, which looked like a
dangerously ambitious encroachment upon the royal prerogative.
Absalom, by the vile counsel of Ahithophel,
had openly taken possession of the ten concubines
whom his father, in his flight from Jerusalem, had left
in charge of the palace. The pseudo-Smerdis, when
he revolted against the absent Cambyses, at once seized
his seraglio.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> It is noted even in our English history
that the relations between the Earl of Mortimer and
Queen Isabella involved danger to the kingdom; and
when Admiral Seymour married Queen Catharine Parr,
widow of Henry VIII., he at once entered into treasonable
conspiracies. Adonijah knew well that he would
powerfully further his ulterior purpose if he could
secure the hand of the lovely Shunamite.</p>

<p>Yet he feared to make the request to Solomon, who
had already inspired him with wholesome awe. With
pretended simplicity he sought the intercession of the
<i>Gebira</i> Bathsheba, who, being the queen-mother, exercised
great influence as the first lady of the land.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> She
it was who had placed the jewelled bridal crown with
her own hand on the head of her young son.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Alarmed at his visit she asked, "Comest thou peaceably?"
He came, he humbly assured her, to ask a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
favour. Might she not think of his case with a little
pity? He was the elder son; the kingdom by right of
primogeniture was his; all Israel, so he flattered himself,
had wished for his accession. But it had all been
in vain, Jehovah had given the kingdom to his brother.
Might he not be allowed some small consolation, some
little accession to his dignity? at least some little source
of happiness in his home?</p>

<p>Flattered by his humility and his appeal, Bathsheba
encouraged him to proceed, and he begged that, as
Solomon would refuse no request to his mother, would
she ask that Abishag might be his wife?</p>

<p>With extraordinary lack of insight, Bathsheba,
ambitious as she was, failed to see the subtle significance
of the request, and promised to present his
petition.</p>

<p>She went to Solomon, who immediately rose to meet
her, and seated her with all honour on a throne at his
right hand.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> She had only come, she said, to ask "a
small petition."</p>

<p>"Ask on, my mother," said the king tenderly, "for
I will not say thee nay."</p>

<p>But no sooner had she mentioned the "small petition"
than Solomon burst into a flame of fury. "Why did
she not ask for the kingdom for Adonijah at once?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
He was the elder. He had the chief priest and the
chief captain with him. They must be privy to this
new plot. But by the God who had given him his
father's kingdom, and established him a house, Adonijah
had made the request to his own cost, and should die
that day."</p>

<p>The command was instantly given to Benaiah, who,
as captain of the body-guard, was also chief executioner.
He slew Adonijah that same hour, and so the third of
David's splendid sons died in his youth a death of violence.</p>

<p>We pause to ask whether the sudden and vehement
outburst of King Solomon's indignation was only due
to political causes? If, as seems almost certain, Abishag
is indeed the fair Shulamite of the Song of Songs, there
can be little doubt that Solomon himself loved her,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and
that she was "the jewel of his seraglio."<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The true
meaning of Canticles is not difficult to read, however
much it may lend itself to mystical and allegorical
applications. It represents a rustic maiden, faithful to
her shepherd lover, resisting all the allurements of a
king's court, and all the blandishments of a king's
affection. It is the one book of Scripture which is
exclusively devoted to sing the glory of a pure love.
The king is magnanimous; he does not force the
beautiful maiden to accept his addresses. Exercising
her freedom, and true to the dictates of her heart, she
rejoicingly leaves the perfumed atmosphere of the
harem of Jerusalem for the sweet and vernal air of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
country home under the shadow of its northern hills.
Solomon's impetuous wrath would not be so unaccountable
if an unrequited affection added the sting of
jealousy to the wrath of offended power. The scene
is the more interesting because it is one of the very
few personal touches in the story of Solomon, which
is chiefly composed of external details, both in Scripture
and in such fragments as have been preserved of the
pagan historian Dios, Eupolemos, Nicolas Polyhistor,
and those referred to by Josephus, Eusebius, and
Clemens of Alexandria.</p>

<p>The fall of Adonijah involved his chief votaries in
ruin. Abiathar had been a friend and follower of
David from his youthful days. When Doeg, the
treacherous Edomite, had informed Saul that the priests
of Nob had shown kindness to David in his hunger
and distress, the demoniac king had not shrunk from
employing the Edomite herdsman to massacre all on
whom he could lay his hands. From this slaughter of
eighty-five priests who wore linen ephods, Abiathar had
fled to David, who alone could protect him from the
king's pursuit.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> In the days when the outlaw lived in
dens and caves, the priest had been constantly with him,
and had been afflicted in all wherein he was afflicted,
and had inquired of God for him. David had recognised
how vast was his debt of gratitude to one
whose father and all his family had been sacrificed for
an act of kindness done to himself. Abiathar had
been chief priest for all the forty years of David's
reign. In Absalom's rebellion he had still been faithful
to the king. His son Jonathan had been David's
scout in the city. Abiathar had helped Zadok to carry
the Ark to the last house by the ascent to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Mount of Olives, and there he had stood under the
olive tree by the wilderness<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> till all the people had
passed by. If his loyalty had been less ardent than
that of his brother-priest Zadok, who had evidently
taken the lead in the matter, he had given no ground
for suspicion. But, perhaps secretly jealous of the
growing influence of his younger rival, the old man, after
some fifty years of unswerving allegiance, had joined
his lifelong friend Joab in supporting the conspiracy
of Adonijah, and had not even now heartily accepted
the rule of Solomon. Assuming his complicity in
Adonijah's request, Solomon sent for him, and sternly
told him that he was "a man of death," <i>i.e.</i>, that death
was his desert. But it would have been outrageous
to slay an aged priest, the sole survivor of a family
slaughtered for David's sake, and one who had so
long stood at the head of the whole religious organisation,
wearing the Urim and carrying the Ark. He
was therefore summarily deposed from his functions,
and dismissed to his paternal fields at Anathoth, a
priestly town about six miles from Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> We
hear no more of him; but Solomon's warning, "I will
not <i>at this time</i> put thee to death," was sufficient to
show him that, if he mixed himself with court intrigues
again, he would ultimately pay the forfeit with his life.
Solomon, like Saul, paid very little regard to "benefit
of the clergy."<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>The doom fell next on the arch-offender Joab, the
white-haired hero of a hundred fights, "the Douglas of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the House of David." He had, if the reading of the
ancient versions be correct, "turned after Adonijah,
and <i>had not turned after Solomon</i>." Solomon could
hardly have felt at ease when a general so powerful
and so popular was disaffected to his rule, and Joab
read his own sentence in the execution of Adonijah.
On hearing the news the old hero fled up Mount Zion,
and clung to the horns of the altar. But Abiathar,
who might have asserted the sacredness of the asylum,
was in disgrace, and Joab was not to escape. "What
has happened to thee that thou hast fled to the altar?"
was the message sent to him by the king. "Because,"
he answered, "I was afraid of thee, and fled unto the
Lord."<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> It was Solomon's habit to give his autocratic
orders with laconic brevity. "Go, fall upon him," he
said to Benaiah.</p>

<p>The scene which ensued was very tragic.</p>

<p>The two rivals were face to face. On the one side
the aged general, who had placed on David's head the
crown of Rabbah, who had saved him from the rebellions
of Absalom and of Sheba, and had been the pillar of
his military glory and dominion for so many years; on
the other the brave soldier-priest, who had won a chief
place among the <i>Gibborim</i> by slaying a lion in a pit on
a snowy day, and "two lion-like men of Moab,"<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and
a gigantic Egyptian whom he had attacked with only
a staff, and out of whose hand he had plucked a spear
like a weaver's beam and killed him with his own spear.
As David lost confidence in Joab he had reposed more
and more confidence in this hero. He had placed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
over the body-guards, whom he trusted more than the
native militia.</p>

<p>The Levite-soldier had no hesitation about acting
as executioner, but he did not like to slay any man,
and above all such a man, in a place so sacred,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>&mdash;in
a place where his blood would be mingled with that of
the sacrifices with which the horns of the altar were
besmeared.</p>

<p>"The king bids thee come forth," he said.</p>

<p>"Nay," said Joab, "but I will die here."</p>

<p>Perhaps he thought that he might be protected by
the asylum, as Adonijah had been; perhaps he hoped
that in any case his blood might cry to God for
vengeance, if he was slain in the sanctuary of Mount
Zion, and on the very altar of burnt offering.</p>

<p>Benaiah naturally scrupled under such circumstances
to carry out Solomon's order, and went back to him
for instruction. Solomon had no such scruples, and
perhaps held that this act was meritorious.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> "Slay
him," he said, "where he stands! He is a twofold
murderer; let his blood be on his head." Then
Benaiah went back and killed him, and was promoted
to his vacant office. Such was the dismal end of so
much valour and so much glory! He had taken the
sword, and he perished by the sword. And the Jews
believed that the curse of David clung to his house
for ever, and that among his descendants there never
lacked one that was a leper, or a lame man, or a suicide,
or a pauper.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Shimei's turn came next. A watchful eye was fixed
implacably on this last indignant representative of the
ruined House of Saul. Solomon had sent and ordered
him to leave his estate at Bahurim, and build a house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
at Jerusalem, forbidding him to go "any whither,"<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and
telling him that if on any pretence he passed the wady
of Kidron he should be put to death. As he could not
visit Bahurim, or any of his Benjamite connexions,
without passing the Kidron, all danger of further
intrigues seemed to be obviated.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> To these terms the
dangerous man had sworn, and for three years he kept
them faithfully. At the end of that time two of his slaves
fled from him to Achish, son of Maachah, King of Gath.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
When informed of their whereabouts, Shimei, apparently
with no thought of evil, saddled his mule and went to
demand their restoration. As he had not crossed the
Kidron, and had merely gone to Gath on private
business, he thought that Solomon would never hear
of it, or would at any rate treat the matter as harmless.
Solomon, however, regarded his conduct as a proof
of retributive dementation. He sent for him, bitterly
upbraided him, and ordered Benaiah to slay him. So
perished the last of Solomon's enemies; but Shimei
had two illustrious descendants in the persons of
Mordecai and Queen Esther.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Solomon perhaps conceived himself to be only acting
up to the true kingly ideal. "A king that sitteth on
the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with
his eyes." "A wise king scattereth the wicked, and
bringeth the wheel over them." "An evil man seeketh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
only rebellion; therefore a cruel messenger shall be
sent against him." "The fear of a king is as the
roaring of a lion, whoso provoketh him to anger
endangereth his own soul."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> On the other hand, he
continued hereditary kindness to Chimham, son of the
old chief Barzillai the Gileadite, who became the founder
of the Khan at Bethlehem in which a thousand years
later Christ was born.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>The elevation of Zadok to the high priesthood
vacated by the disgrace of Abiathar restored the priestly
succession to the elder line of the House of Aaron.
Aaron had been the father of four sons: Nadab, Abihu,
Eleazar, and Ithamar. The two eldest had perished
childless in the wilderness, apparently for the profanation
of serving the tabernacle while in a state of intoxication
and offering "strange fire" upon the altar.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
The son of Eleazar was the fierce priestly avenger
Phinehas. The order of succession was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
            &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;       <span class="smcap">Aaron.</span>
                             |
                   +---------+------+
                   |                |
                 Eleazar.        Ithamar.
                 Phinehas.       (gap.)
                 Abishua.        Eli.
                 Bukki.          Phinehas.
                 Uzzi.           Ahitub.
                 Zerahiah.       Ahiah (1 Sam. xiv. 3).
                 Meraioth.       Ahimelech.
                 Amariah.        Abiathar (1 Sam. xxii. 20).
                 Ahitub.
                 Zadok.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
</pre>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>The question naturally arises how the line of succession
came to be disturbed, since to Eleazar, and
his seed after him, had been promised "the covenant
of an everlasting priesthood."<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> As the elder line continued
unbroken, how was it that, for five generations
at least, from Eli to Abiathar, we find the <i>younger</i> line
of Ithamar in secure and lineal possession of the high
priesthood? The answer belongs to the many strange
reserves of Jewish history. It is clear from the silence
of the Book of Chronicles that the intrusion, however
caused, was an unpleasant recollection. Jewish tradition
has perhaps revealed the secret, and a very curious
one it is. We are told that Phinehas was high priest
when Jephthah made his rash vow, and that his was
the hand which carried out the human sacrifice of
Jephthah's daughter. But the inborn feelings of
humanity in the hearts of the people were stronger
than the terrors of superstition, and arising in indignation
against the high priest who could thus imbrue his
hands in an innocent maiden's blood, they drove him
from his office and appointed a son of Ithamar in his
place. The story then offers a curious analogy to that
told of the Homeric hero Idomeneus, King of Crete.
Caught in a terrible storm on his return from Troy, he
too vowed that if his life were saved he would offer
up in sacrifice the first living thing that met him. His
eldest son came forth with gladness to meet him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Idomeneus fulfilled his vow, but the Cretans rose in
revolt against the ruthless father, and a civil war ensued,
in which a hundred cities were destroyed and the king
was driven into exile. The Jewish tradition is one
which could hardly have been invented. It is certain
that Jephthah's daughter <i>was</i> offered up in sacrifice, in
accordance with his rash vow. This could hardly have
been done by any but a priest, and the ferocious zeal
of Phinehas would not perhaps have shrunk from the
horrible consummation. Revolting, even abhorrent, as
is such a notion from our views of God, and decisively
as human sacrifice is condemned by all the highest
teaching of Scripture, the traces of this horrible tendency
of human guilt and human fear are evident
in the history of Israel as of all other early nations.
Some thought akin to it must have lain under the
temptation of Abraham to offer up his son Isaac.
Twelve centuries later Manasseh "made his son pass
through the fire," and kindled the furnaces of Moloch
at Tophet in Gehenna, the valley of the sons of
Hinnom.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> His grandfather Ahaz had done the same
before him, offering sacrifice and burning his children
in the fire.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Surrounded by kindred tribes, to which
this worship was familiar, the Israelites, in their ignorance
and backsliding, were not exempt from its fatal
fascination. Solomon himself "went after," and built
a high place for Milcom, the abomination of the
Ammonites, on the right hand of "the hill that is before
Jerusalem," which from this desecration got the name
of "The Mount of Corruption." These high places
continued, and it must be supposed, had their votaries
on "that opprobrious hill," until good Josiah dismantled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
and defiled them about the year 639, some three
centuries after they had been built.</p>

<p>But whether this legend about Phinehas be tenable
or not, it is certain that the House of Ithamar fell into
deadly disrepute and abject misery. In this the people
saw the fulfilment of an old traditional curse, pronounced
by some unknown "man of God" on the
House of Eli, that there should be no old man in
his house for ever; that his descendants should die
in the flower of their age; and that they should come
cringing to the descendants of the priest whom God
would raise up in his stead, to get some humble place
about the priesthood for a piece of silver and a morsel
of bread.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>The prolongation of the curse in the House of Joab
and of Eli furnishes an illustration of the menacing
appendix to the second commandment&mdash;"For I the
Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the sins of
the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth
generation of them that hate Me, and showing mercy
unto thousands (of generations) of them that love Me
and keep My commandments."</p>

<p>There is in families, as in communities, a solidarity
alike of blessing and curse. No man perishes alone
in his iniquity, whether he be an offender like Achan
or an offender like Joab. Families have their inheritance
of character, their prerogative examples of misdoing,
their influence of the guilty past flowing like
a tide of calamity over the present and the future!
The physical consequences of transgression remain
long after the sins which caused them have ended.
Three things, however, are observable in this, as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
every faithfully recorded history. One is that mercy
boasteth over justice, and the area of beneficent consequence
is more permanent and more continuous than
that of the entailed curse, as right is always more
permanent than wrong. A second is that, though man
at all times is liable to troubles and disabilities, no
innocent person who suffers temporal afflictions from
the sins of his forefathers shall suffer one element
of unjust depression in the eternal interests of life.
A third is that the ultimate prosperity of the children,
alike of the righteous and of sinners, is in their own
control; each soul shall perish, and shall only perish,
for its own sin. In this sense, though the fathers have
eaten sour grapes, the teeth of the children shall <i>not</i>
be set on edge. In the long generations the line of
David no less than the line of Joab, the line of Zadok
no less than that of Abiathar, was destined to feel the
Nemesis of evil-doing, and to experience that, of whatever
parentage men are born, the law remains true&mdash;"Say
ye of the righteous, that it shall be well with
him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. Woe
unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the
reward of his hands shall be given him."<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>It would have thrown an interesting light on the
character and development of Solomon, if we had
been able to conjecture with any certainty what was
his age when the death of David made him the unquestioned
king. The pagan historian Eupolemos,
quoted by Eusebius, says that he was twelve; Josephus
asserts that he was fifteen. If Rehoboam was indeed
as old as forty-one when he came to the throne
(1 Kings xiv. 21), Solomon can hardly have been less
than twenty at his accession, for in that case he must
have been married before David's death (1 Kings xi. 42).
But the reading "forty-one" in 1 Kings xiv. 21 is
altered by some into "twenty-one," and we are left in
complete uncertainty. Solomon is called "a child"
(1 Kings iii. 7), "young and tender" (1 Chron. xxix. 1);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
but his acts show the full vigour and decision of a
man.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>The composite character of the Books of Kings
leads to some disturbance of the order of events,
and 1 Kings iii. 1-4 is perhaps inserted to explain
Solomon's sacrifice at the high place of Gibeon,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
where stood the brazen altar of the old Tabernacle.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
But no apology is needed for that act.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The use of
high places, even when they were consecrated to the
worship of Jehovah, was regarded in later days as
involving principles of danger, and became a grave
offence in the eyes of all who took the Deuteronomic
standpoint. But high places to Jehovah, as distinct
from those dedicated to idols, were not condemned by
the earlier prophets, and the resort to them was never
regarded as blameworthy before the establishment of
the central sanctuary.</p>

<p>After the frightful massacre of the descendants of
Aaron at Nob, the old "Tabernacle of the congregation"
and the great brazen altar of burnt offerings had
been removed to Gibeon from a city defiled by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
blood of priests.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Gibeon stood on a commanding
elevation within easy distance of Jerusalem, and was
henceforth regarded as "the great high place," until
the Temple on Mount Zion was finished. Thither
Solomon went in that imposing civil, religious, and
military procession of which the tradition may be preserved
in the name of Wady Suleiman still given to
the adjoining valley. There, with Oriental magnificence,
like Xerxes at Troy, he offered what the Greeks called
a <i>chiliombe</i>, that is, a tenfold hecatomb of burnt offerings.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
This "thousandfold holocaust," as the Septuagint
terms it, must have been a stately and long-continued
function, and in approval of his sacrifice Jehovah
granted a vision to the youthful king. Will the Lord
be pleased with thousands of rams and ten thousands
of rivers of oil, when all the beasts of the forest are
His, and the cattle upon a thousand hills? "Thinkest
thou," He asked, in the words of the Psalmist, "that
I will eat bull's flesh or drink the blood of goats?"
No; but God always accepts a willing sacrifice in
accordance with the purpose and sincerity of the giver.
In reward for the pure intention of the king He appeared
to Solomon in a dream, and said, "Ask what
I shall give thee."</p>

<p>The Jews recognised three modes of Divine communication&mdash;by
dreams; by Urim, and by prophets.
The highest and most immediate illumination was the
prophetic. The revelation by means of the primitive
Urim and Thummin, the oracle and jewelled breastplate
of the high priest, was the poorest, the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
elementary, the most liable to abuse. It was analogous
to the method used by the Egyptian chief priests, who
wore round their necks a sapphire ornament called
Thmei, or "truth," for purposes of divination.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> After
the death of David the Urim and Thummin fell into
such absolute desuetude, as a survival of primitive
times, that we do not read of its being consulted again
in a single instance. It is not so much as mentioned
during the five centuries of the history of the kings,
and we do not hear of it afterwards. Solomon never
once inquired of the priests as David did repeatedly.
In the reign of Solomon the voice of prophecy, too,
was silent, until disasters began to cloud its close.
Times of material prosperity and autocratic splendour
are unfavourable to the prophet's function, and sometimes,
as in the days of Ahab, the prophets themselves
"philippised" in Jehovah's name. But revelation by
dreams occurs in all ages. In his prophecy of the
great future, Joel says, "Your old men shall see
visions, your young men shall dream dreams." It
is true that dreams must always have a subjective
element, yet, as Aristotle says, "The visions of the
noble are better than those of common men."<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The
dreams of night are reflections of the thoughts of day.
"Solomon worships God by day; God appears to
Solomon by night. Well may we look to enjoy God,
when we have served Him."<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Full of the thoughts
inspired by an intense devotion, and a yearning desire
to rule aright, the sleeping soul of Solomon became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
bright with eyes,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> and in his dream he made a worthy
answer to the appeal of God.</p>

<p>"Ask what I shall give thee!" That blessed and
most loving offer is made to every human soul. To
the meanest of us all God flings open the treasuries
of heaven. The reason why we fatally lose them is
because we are blinded by the glamour of temptation,
and snatch instead at glittering bubbles or Dead Sea
fruits. We fail to attain the best gifts, because so few
of us earnestly desire them, and so many disbelieve
the offer that is made of them. Yet there is no living
soul to which God has not given the choice of good
and evil. "He hath set fire and water before thee:
stretch forth thy hand unto whether thou wilt. Before
man is life and death; and whether him liketh shall be
given him."<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Even when our choice is not evil it is
often desperately frivolous, and it is only too late that
we rue the folly of having rejected the better and chosen
the worse.</p>

</div></div>

<p>But Solomon made the wise choice. In his dream
he thanked God for His mercifully fulfilled promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
to David his father, and with the touching humble
confession, "I am but a little child: I know not how
to go out or come in,"<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> he begged for an understanding
heart to judge between right and wrong in guiding his
great and countless people.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>God was pleased with the noble, unselfish request.
The youthful king might have besought the boon of
"many days," which was so highly valued before Christ
had brought life and immortality to light; or for riches,
or for victory over his enemies. Instead of this he had
asked for "understanding, to discern judgment," and
the lesser gifts were freely accorded him. "Seek ye
first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness, and
all these things shall be added unto you."<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> God
promised him that he should be a king of unprecedented
greatness. He freely gave him riches and honour, and,
conditionally on his continued faithfulness, a long life.
The condition was broken, and Solomon was not more
than sixty years old when he was called before the
God whom he forsook.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>"And Solomon awoke, and behold it was a dream."
But he knew well that it was also more than a dream,
and that "God giveth to His beloved even sleeping."<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>In reverential gratitude he offered a second sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
of burnt offerings before the ark on Mount Zion, and
added to them peace offerings, with which he made
a great feast to all his servants. Twice again did God
appear to Solomon; but the second time it was to
warn, and the third time to condemn.</p>

<p>In the parallel account given by the chronicler,
Solomon says, "Give me now wisdom and knowledge,"
and God replies, "Wisdom and knowledge is granted
unto thee." There is a wide difference between the
two things. Knowledge may come while wisdom still
lingers, and wisdom may exist in Divine abundance
where knowledge is but scant and superficial. The
wise may be as ignorant as St. Antony, or St. Francis
of Assisi; the masters of those who know may show
as little 'wisdom for a man's self' as Abélard, or as
Francis Bacon. "Among the Jews one set of terms
does service to express both intellectual and moral
wisdom. The 'wise' man means the righteous man;
the 'fool' is one who is godless. Intellectual terms
that describe knowledge are also moral terms describing
life." No doubt in the ultimate senses of the words
there can be no true knowledge, as there can be no
perfect wisdom, without goodness. This was a truth
with which Solomon himself became deeply impressed.
"The fear of the Lord," he said, "is the beginning
of wisdom, but fools despise knowledge and understanding."
The lineaments of "a fool" are drawn
in the Book of Proverbs, and they bear the impress
of moral baseness and moral aberrations.</p>

<p>To Solomon both boons were given, "wisdom and
understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart,
even as the sand that is on the sea shore." Of his
many forms of intellectual eminence I will speak later
on. What he longed for most was evidently moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
insight and practical sagacity. He felt that "through
justice shall the throne be established."</p>

<p>Practical wisdom was eminently needed for the
office of a judge.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Judgeship was a main function of
Eastern royalty, and rulers were called <i>Shophetim</i> or
judges.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The reality of the gift which Solomon had
received from God was speedily to be tested.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Two
harlots came before him.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> One had overlaid her child
in the night, and stealing the living child of the other
she put her dead child in its place. There was no
evidence to be had. It was simply the bare word of
one disreputable woman against the bare word of the
other. With instant decision, and a flash of insight
into the springs of human actions, Solomon gave the
apparently childish order to cut the children in two,
and divide them between the claimants. The people
laughed,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> and the delinquent accepted the horrible
decision; but the mother of the living child yearned for
her babe, and she cried out, "O my lord, give her the
living babe,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> and in no wise slay it." "<i>Give her the
living babe, and in no wise slay it</i>," murmured the king
to himself, repeating the mother's words; and then he
burst out with the triumphant verdict, "Give <i>her</i> the
living child! <i>she</i> is the mother thereof!"<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>The story has several parallels. It is said by
Diodorus Siculus that when three youths came before
Ariopharnes, King of Thrace, each claiming to be the
only son of the King of the Cimmerians, he ordered
them each to hurl a javelin at their father's corpse.
Two obeyed, one refused, and Ariopharnes at once
proclaimed him to be the true son.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Similarly an
Indian story tells that a woman, before she bathed, left
her child on the bank of the pool, and a female demon
carried it off. The goddess, before whom each claimed
the child, ordered them to pull it in two between them,
and consigned it to the mother who shuddered at the
test.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> A judgment similarly founded on filial instinct
is attributed to the Emperor Claudius. A mother
refused to acknowledge her son; and as there were
no proofs Claudius ordered her to marry the youth,
whereupon she was obliged to acknowledge that he
was her son.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>Modern critics, wise after the event, express themselves
very slightingly of the amount of intelligence
required for the decision; but the people saw the value
of the presence of mind and rapid intuition which settled
the question by bringing an individual dilemma under
the immediate arbitrament of a general law. They
rejoiced to recognise the practical wisdom which God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
had given to their young king. The word <i>Chokhmah</i>,
which is represented by one large section of Jewish
literature, implied the practical intelligence derived from
insight or experience, the power to govern oneself and
others. Its conclusions were expressed chiefly in a
gnomic form, and they pass through various stages in
the Sapiential Books of the Old Testament. The chief
books of the <i>Chokhmah</i> are the Books of Proverbs, Job,
and Ecclesiastes, followed by such books as Wisdom
and Ecclesiasticus. On the Divine side Wisdom is the
Spirit of God, regarded by man under the form of
Providence (Wisdom i. 4, 7, vii. 7, 22, ix. 17); and on
the human side it is trustworthy knowledge of the
things that are (<i>id.</i> vii. 17). It is, in fact, "a knowledge
of Divine and human things, and of their causes"
(4 Macc. ii. 16). This branch of wisdom could be
repeatedly shown by Solomon at the city gate and in
the hall of judgment.</p>

<p>2. His varied <i>intellectual</i> wisdom created deeper
astonishment. He spake, we are told, "of trees from
the cedar which is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop
that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts
and fowl and of creeping things and of fishes." This
knowledge has been misunderstood and exaggerated by
later tradition. It is expanded in the Book of Wisdom
(viii. 17) into a perfect knowledge of kosmogony,
astronomy, the alterations of solstices, the cycles of
years, the natures of wild beasts, the forces of spirits,
the reasonings of men, the diversities of plants.
Solomon became to Eastern legend</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>
<p>His knowledge, however, does not seem to have been
even empirically scientific. It consisted in the moral
and religious illustration of truth by emblems derived
from nature.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> He surpassed, we are told, the ethnic

and mystic wisdom of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Ethan and Heman were

singers;<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> and all four were famed for wisdom; but
Solomon excelled them all. Of his one thousand and
five songs, the majority were probably secular. Only
two psalms are even traditionally assigned to him.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
Of his three thousand proverbs not more than two
hundred survive, even if all in the Book of Proverbs
be his. Tradition adds that he was a master of
"riddles" or "dark sayings," by which he won largely
in fines from Hiram, whom he challenged for their
solution, until the Tyrian king defeated him by the aid
of a sharp youth named Abdemon.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Specimens of

This book also contains various ambiguous hard sayings
of which the skilful construction awoke admiration and
stimulated thought.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The Queen of Sheba is said to

and possessed a seal which gave him mastery over the
genii. In the Book of Wisdom he is made to say, "All
such things as are either secret or manifest, them I
know." Josephus attributes to him the formulæ and
spells of exorcism, and in Eccles. ii. 8 the words
rendered "musical instruments" (shiddah and shiddoth;
R.V., "concubines very many") were understood by
the Rabbis to mean that he was the lord over male
and female demons.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>3. Far more precious than practical or intellectual
ability is the gift of <i>moral</i> wisdom, which Solomon so
greatly appreciated but so imperfectly attained. Yet
he felt that "wisdom is the principal thing, therefore
get wisdom." The world gives that name to many
higher and lower manifestations of capacity and attainment,
but wisdom is in Scripture the one law of all true
life. In that magnificent outburst of Semitic poetry,
the twenty-eighth chapter of the Book of Job, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
pointing out that there is such a thing as natural
knowledge&mdash;that there is a vein for the silver, and ore
of gold, and a place of sapphires, and reservoirs of
subterranean fire&mdash;the writer asks: "But where shall
wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?"
After showing with marvellous power
that it is beyond man's unaided search&mdash;that the depths
and the seas say, "It is not in us," and destruction and
death have but heard the fame thereof with their ears&mdash;he
adds with one great crash of concluding music,
"God understandeth the way thereof, and He knoweth
the place thereof.... And unto man He said, <i>Behold,
the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from
evil is understanding</i>."<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> And again we read, "<i>The fear
of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge</i>."<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> The sated
cynic of the Book of the Ecclesiastes, or one who had
studied, not without dissatisfaction, his sad experience,
adds, "<i>Fear God, and keep His commandments: for this
is the whole duty of man</i>." And in answer to the
question "<i>Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge
among you?</i>" St. James, the Lord's brother, who
had evidently been a deep student of the Sapiential
literature, does not answer, "He who understands all
mysteries," or, "He who speaks with the tongue of men
or of angels," but, "Let him show out of a good conversation
his works with meekness of wisdom." Men
whom the world has deemed wise have often fallen into
utter infatuation, as it is written, "He taketh the wise in
their own craftiness"; but heavenly wisdom may belong
to the most ignorant and simplehearted. It is "first
pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated,
without partiality and without hypocrisy."</p>

<p>We should observe, however, that the <i>Chokhmah</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
or wisdom-literature of the Jews, while it incessantly
exalts morality, and sometimes almost attains to a
perception of the spiritual life, was neither prophetic
nor priestly in its character. It bears the same relation
to the teaching of the prophets on the one hand, and
the priests on the other, as morality does to religion
and to externalism. Its teaching is loftier and truer
than the petty insistence of Pharisaism on meats and
drinks and divers washings, in that it deals with the
weightier matters of the law; but it does not attain to
the passionate spirituality of the greater Hebrew seers.
It cares next to nothing for ritual, and therefore rises
above the developed Judaism of the post-exilic epoch.
It is lofty and true inasmuch as it breathes the spirit
of the Ten Commandments, but it has not learnt the
freedom of love and the beatitudes of perfect union
with God. In one word, it finds its culmination in
Proverbs and Ecclesiasticus, rather than in the spirit of
the Sermon on the Mount and the Gospel of St. John.</p>

<p>We cannot better conclude this chapter than with
the eulogy of the son of Sirach: "Solomon reigned in
a peaceable time and was honoured; for God made all
quiet round about him, that he might build a house in
His name and prepare His sanctuary for ever. How
wise wast thou in thy youth, and, as a flood, filled with
understanding! Thy soul covered the whole earth, and
thou filledst it with dark parables. Thy name went far
unto the islands, and for thy peace thou wast beloved.
The countries marvelled at thee for thy songs, and
proverbs, and parables, and interpretations. By the
name of the Lord God, who is called the Lord God of
Israel, thou didst gather gold as tin, and didst multiply
silver as lead."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>When David was dead, and Solomon was established
on his throne, his first thoughts were
turned to the consolidation of his kingdom. He was
probably quite a youth.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> He was not, nor did he ever
desire to be, a warlike prince; but he was compelled to
make himself secure from two enemies&mdash;Hadad and
Rezon&mdash;who began almost at once to threaten his
frontiers. Of these, however, we shall speak later on,
since it is only towards the close of Solomon's reign
that they seem to have given serious trouble. If the
second psalm is by Solomon it may point to some early
disturbances among heathen neighbours which he had
successfully put down.</p>

<p>The only actual expedition which Solomon ever
made was one against a certain Hamath-Zobah, to
which, however, very little importance can be attached.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
It is simply mentioned in one line in the Book of
Chronicles, and it is hard to believe&mdash;considering that
Rezon had possession of Damascus&mdash;that Solomon
was master of the <i>great</i> Hamath.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> He made a material
alteration in the military organisation of his kingdom
by establishing a standing army of fourteen hundred
war-chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he
dispersed in various cities and barracks, keeping some
of them at Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>In order to save his kingdom from attack Solomon
expended vast sums on the fortification of frontier
towns. In the north he fortified Hazor; in the north-west
Megiddo. The passes to Jerusalem on the west
were rendered safe by the fortresses at Upper and
Nether Bethhoron. The southern districts were overawed
by the building of Baalath and Tamar, "the
palm-city," which is described as "in the wilderness
in the land,"&mdash;perhaps in the desolate tract on the
road from Hebron to Elath.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Movers thinks that
Hazezon-Tamar or Engedi is meant, as this town is
called Tamar in Ezek. xlvii. 19.</p>

<p>As the king grew more and more in power he gave
full reins to his innate love of magnificence. We can
best estimate the sudden leap of the kingdom into
luxurious civilisation if we contrast the royalty of Saul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
with that of Solomon. Saul was little more than a
peasant-prince, a local emîr, and such state as he had
was of the humblest description. But Solomon vied
with the gorgeous secular dynasts of historic empires.</p>

<p>His position had become much more splendid owing
to his alliance with the King of Egypt&mdash;an alliance of
which his humbler predecessors would scarcely have
dreamed. We are not told the name of his Egyptian
bride, but she must have been the daughter of one
of the last kings of the twenty-first Tanite dynasty&mdash;either
Psinaces, or Psusennes II.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> The dynasty had
been founded at Tanis (Zoan) about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1100 by an
ambitious priest named Hir-hor. It only lasted for five
generations. Whatever other dower Solomon received
with this Egyptian princess, his father-in-law rendered
him one signal service. He advanced from Egypt with
an army against the Canaanite town of Gezer, which
he conquered and destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Solomon rebuilt it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
an outpost of defence for Jerusalem. Further than
this the Egyptian alliance did not prove to be of much
use. The last king of this weak twenty-first dynasty was
succeeded <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 990 by the founder of a new Bubastite
dynasty, the great Shishak I. (Shesonk, &#931;&#949;&#963;&#8057;&#957;&#967;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962;),
the protector of Jeroboam and the plunderer of Jerusalem
and its Temple. Ker'amat, niece of the last king
of the dynasty, married Shishak, the founder of the new
dynasty, and was the mother of U-Sark-on I. (Zerah
the Ethiopian).</p>

<p>It has been a matter of dispute among the Rabbis
whether Solomon was commendable or blameworthy
for contracting this foreign alliance. If we judge him
simply from the secular standpoint, nothing could be
more obviously politic than the course he took. Nor
did he break any law in marrying Pharaoh's daughter.
Moses had not forbidden the union with an Egyptian
woman. Still, from the religious point of view, it was
inevitable that such a connexion would involve consequences
little in accordance with the theocratic ideal.
The kings of Judah must not be judged as though
they were ordinary sovereigns. They were meant to
be something more than mere worldly potentates. The
Egyptian alliance, instead of flattering the pride, only
wounded the susceptibilities of the later Jews. The
Rabbis had a fantastic notion that Shimei had been
Solomon's teacher, and that the king did not fall into
the error of wedding an alien<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> until Shimei had been
driven from Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> That there was some sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
of doubt in Solomon's mind appears from the statement
in 2 Chron. viii. 11, that he deemed it unfit for his
bride to have her residence on Mount Moriah, a spot
hallowed by the presence of the Ark of God.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> That she
became a proselytess has been suggested, but it is most
unlikely. Had this been the case it would have been
mentioned in contrast with the heathenism of the fair
idolatresses who in later years beguiled the king's
heart. On the other hand, the princess, who was his
chief if not his earliest bride, does not seem to have
asked for any shrine or chapel for the practice of her
Egyptian rites. This is the more remarkable since
Solomon, ashamed of the humble cedar house of David&mdash;which
would look despicable to a lady who had lived
in "the gigantic edifices, and labyrinthine palace of
Egyptian kings"<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>&mdash;expended vast sums in building her
a palace which should seem worthy of her royal race.</p>

<p>From this time forward the story of Solomon becomes
more the record of a passing pageant preserved for us
in loosely arranged fragments. It can never be one
tithe so interesting as the history of a human heart
with its sufferings and passions. "Solomon in all his
glory," that figure so unique, so lonely in its wearisome
pomp, can never stir our sympathy or win our affection
as does the natural, impetuous David, or even the fallen,
unhappy Saul. "The low sun makes the colour."
The bright gleams and dark shadows of David's life are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
more instructive than the dull monotony of Solomon's
magnificence.</p>

<p>The large space of Scripture devoted to him in the
Books of Kings and Chronicles is occupied almost
exclusively with the details of architecture and display.
It is only in the first and last sections of his story that
we catch the least glimpse of the man himself. In the
central section we see nothing of him, but are absorbed
in measurements and descriptions which have a purely
archæological, or, at the best, a dimly symbolic significance.
The man is lost in the monarch, the monarch
in the appurtenances of his royal display. His annals
degenerate into the record of a sumptuous parade.</p>

<p>The fourth chapter of the Book of Kings gives us
the constitution of his court as it was in the middle of
his reign, when two of his daughters were already
married. It need not detain us long.</p>

<p>The highest officers of the kingdom were called
<i>Sarim</i>, "princes," a title which in David's reign had
been borne almost alone by Joab, who was <i>Sar-ha-zaba</i>,
or captain of the host. The son of Zadok<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> is named first
as "the priest." The two chief secretaries (<i>Sopherim</i>)
were Elihoreph and Ahiah. They inherited the office
of their father Shavsha (1 Chron. xviii. 16),<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> who had
been the secretary of David. It was their duty to
record decrees and draw up the documents of state.
Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, continued to hold the
office of annalist or historiographer (<i>Mazkîr</i>), the officer
known as the Waka Nuwish in Persian courts.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Azariah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
was over the twelve prefects (<i>Nitzabim</i>), or farmers-general,
who administered the revenues.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> His brother
Zabud became "priest" and "king's friend."<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Ahishar
was "over the household" (<i>al-hab-Baith</i>); that is,
he was the chamberlain, vizier, or mayor of the palace,
wearing on his shoulder the key which was the symbol
of his authority.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Adoniram or Adoram, who had been
tax-collector for David, still held that onerous and
invidious office,<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> which subsequently, in his advanced
old age, cost him his life. Benaiah succeeded to the
chief-captaincy of Joab. We hear nothing more of
him, but the subsequent history shows that when David
gathered around him this half alien and wholly mercenary
force in a country which had no standing army,
he turned the sovereignty into what the Greeks would
have called a tyranny. As the only armed force in the
kingdom the body-guard overawed opposition, and was
wholly at the disposal of the king. These troops were
to Solomon at Jerusalem what the Prætorians were to
Tiberius at Rome.</p>

<p>The chief points of interest presented by the list are
these:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. First we mark the absence of any prophet. Neither
Nathan nor Gad is even mentioned. The pure ray of
Divine illumination is overpowered by the glitter of
material prosperity.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, the priests are quite subordinate. They
are only mentioned fifth in order, and Abiathar is named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
with Zadok, though after his deposition he was living
in enforced retirement.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> The sacerdotal authority was
at this time quite overshadowed by the royal. In all
the elaborate details of the pomp which attended the
consecration of the Temple, Solomon is everything, the
priests comparatively nothing. Zadok is not even mentioned
as taking any part in the sacrifices in spite of
his exalted rank. Solomon acts throughout as supreme
head of the Church. Nor was this unnatural, since the
two capital events in the history of the worship of
Jehovah&mdash;the removal of the Ark to Mount Zion, and
the suggestion, inception, and completion of the building
of the Temple&mdash;were due to Solomon and David, not
to Zadok or Abiathar. The priests, throughout the
monarchy, suggest nothing, inaugurate nothing. They
are lost in functions and formal ceremonies. They are
but obedient administrative servants, and, so far from
protecting religion, they acquiesce with tame indifference
in every innovation and every apostasy. History has
few titles which form so poor a claim to distinction as
that of Levitic priest.</p>

<p>3. Further, we have two curious and significant
phenomena. The title "the priest" is given to Azariah,
who is first mentioned among the court functionaries.
Solomon had not the least intention to allow either
the priestly or the much loftier prophetic functions to
interfere with his autocracy. He did not choose that
there should be any danger of a priest usurping an
exorbitant influence, as Hir-hor had done in Egypt, or
Ethbaal afterwards did in the court of Tyre, or Thomas
à-Becket in the court of England, or Torquemada in
that of Spain. He was too much a king to submit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
priestly domination. He therefore appointed one who
should be "the priest" for courtly and official purposes,
and should stand in immediate subordination to himself.</p>

<p>4. The Nathan whose two sons, Azariah and
Zabud, held such high positions, was in all probability
not Nathan the Prophet, who is rarely introduced
without his distinctive title, but Nathan, the younger
brother of Solomon, in whose line the race of David
was continued after the extinction of the elder branch
in Jeconiah. Here again we note the union of <i>civil</i>
with priestly functions. Zabud is called "a priest"
though he is a layman, a prince of the tribe of Judah.
Nor was this the first instance in which princes of the
royal house had found maintenance, occupation, and
high official rank by being in some sort engaged in the
functions of the priesthood. Already in David's reign
we find the title "priests" (<i>Kohanim</i>) given to the sons
of David in the list of court officials<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>&mdash;"<i>and David's
sons were priests</i>." In this we trace the possible results
of Ph&#339;nician influences.</p>

<p>5. Incidentally it is pleasing to find that, though
Solomon put Adonijah to death, he stood in close and
kindly relations with his other brothers, and gave high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
promotions to the sons of the brothers who stood
nearest to him in age, in one of whom we see the
destined ancestor of the future Messiah.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>6. The growth of imposing officialism, and its
accompanying gulf between the king and his people, is
marked by the first appearance of "the chamberlain"
as a new functionary. On him fell the arrangement
of court pageants and court etiquette. The chamberlain
in despotic Eastern courts becomes a personage of
immense importance, because he controls the right of
admission into the royal presence. Such officers, even
when chosen from the lowest rank of slaves&mdash;like
Eutropius the eunuch-minister of Arcadius,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> or Olivier
le Daim, the barber-minister of Louis XI.&mdash;often absorb
no mean part of the influence of the sovereign with
whom they are brought into daily connexion. In the
court of Solomon the chamberlain stands only ninth in
order; but three centuries later, in the days of Hezekiah,
he has become the greatest of the officials, and "Eliakim
who was over the household" is placed before Shebna,
the influential scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph the
recorder.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>7. Last on the list stands the minister who has
the ominous title of <i>al-ham-Mas</i>, or "over the tribute."
The Mas means the "levy," corvée, or forced labour.
In other words, Adoram was overseer of the soccagers.
Saul had required an overseer of the flocks, and David
a guardian of the treasury, but Adoram is not mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
till late in his reign.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> The <i>gravamen</i> of David's
numbering of the people seems to have lain in the
intention to subject them to a poll tax, or to personal
service, such as had become necessary to maintain the
expenses of the court. It is obvious that, as royalty
developed from the conception of the theocratic king
to that of the Oriental despot, the stern warning of
Samuel to the people of Israel was more and more
fulfilled. They had said, "Nay, but we will have a
king to reign over us, when Jehovah was their king";
and Samuel had told them how much less blessed was
bondage with ease than their strenuous liberty. He
had warned them that their king would take their
sons for his runners and charioteers and reapers and
soldiers and armourers, and their daughters for his
perfumers and confectioners; and that he would seize
their fields and vineyards for his courtiers, and claim
the tithes of their possession, and use their asses, and
put their oxen to his work. The word "<i>Mas</i>" representing
soccage, serfdom, forced labour (corvée; Germ.,
<i>Frohndienst</i>), first became odiously familiar in the days
of Solomon.</p>

<p>Solomon was an expensive king, and the Jewish
kings had no private revenue from which the necessary
resources could be supplied. In order to secure contributions
for the maintenance of the royal establishment,
Solomon appointed his twelve Prefects. The
list of them is incorporated from a document so ancient
that in several instances the names have dropped out,
and only "son of" remains.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> The districts entirely
and designedly ignored the old tribal limits, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Solomon probably wished to obliterate. Ben-Hur
administered the hill country of Ephraim; Ben-Dekar
had his headquarters in Dan; Ben-Hesed had the
maritime plain; Ben-Abinadab the fertile region of
Carmel, and he was wedded to Solomon's daughter
Taphath;<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Baana, son of Ahilud, managed the plain of
Esdraelon; Ben-Geber the mountainous country east
of Jordan, including Gilead and Argob with its basaltic
towns; Ahinadab, son of Iddo, was officer in Mahanaim;
Ahimaaz in Naphtali (he was married to Solomon's
daughter Basmath, and was perhaps the son of Zadok);
Baanah, son of David's faithful Hushai, was in Asher;
Shimei, son of Elah, in Benjamin; Jehoshaphat in
Issachar. Geber administered alone the ancient dominions
of Sihon and Og. We see with surprise that
Judah seems to have been exempted from the burdens
imposed on the other districts, and if so the impolitic
exemption was a main cause of the subsequent jealousies.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>The chief function of these officers was to furnish
provisions for the immense numbers who were connected
with the court. The curious list is given of
the provision required for one day&mdash;thirty measures of
fine flour, sixty of bread,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> ten fat oxen, twenty pasture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
oxen, and one hundred sheep, besides the delicacies of
harts, gazelles, fallow-deer, and fatted guinea-hens or
swans.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Bunsen reckons that this would provide for
about fifteen thousand persons. In this there is nothing
extraordinary, though the number is disproportionate
to the smallness of the kingdom. About the same
number were daily supported by the kings of the great
empire of Persia.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> We see how rapidly the state of
royalty had developed when we compare Solomon's
superb surroundings with the humble palace of Ishbosheth
less than fifty years earlier&mdash;a palace of which
the only guard was a single sleepy woman, who had
been sifting wheat in the noontide, and had fallen
asleep over her task in the porch.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>Yet in the earlier years of the reign, while the people,
dazzled by the novel sense of national importance, felt
the stimulus given to trade and industry, the burden
was not painfully felt. They multiplied in numbers,
and lived under their vines and fig trees in peace and
festivity.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> But much of their prosperity was hollow
and shortlived. Wealth led to vice and corruption,
and in place of the old mountain breezes of freedom
which purified the air, the nation, like Issachar, became
like an ass crouching between two burdens, and bowing
its shoulders to the yoke in the hot valley of sensuous
servitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>It is impossible to overlook the general drift of
Jewish royalty towards pure materialism in the days
of Solomon. We search in vain for the lofty spirituality
which survived even in the rough epoch of the
Judges and the rude simplicity of David's earlier reign.
The noble aspirations which throb in one Davidic
psalm are worth all the gorgeous formalism of the
Temple service. Amid the luxuries of plenty and the
feasts of wine on the lees there seems to have been
an ever-deeping famine of the Word of God.</p>

<p>There was one innovation, which struck the imagination
of Solomon's contemporaries, but was looked on
with entire disfavour by those who had been trained in
the old pious days. Solomon had immense stables for
his chariot horses (<i>susim</i>), and the swift riding horses
of his couriers (<i>parashim</i>).<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> It seems to have been
Solomon's ambition to equal or outshine "the chariots
of Pharaoh,"<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> with which his Egyptian queen had been
familiar at Tanis. This feature of his reign is dwelt
upon in the Arabian legends, as well as in all the

of a cavalry force had always been discouraged
by the religious teachers of Israel. The use of horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
in war is forbidden in Deuteronomy.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Joshua had
houghed the horses of the Canaanites, and burned their
chariots at Misrephoth-maim. David had followed his
example. Barak had defeated the iron chariots of
Sisera, and David the splendid cavalry of Hadadezer
with the simple infantry of Israel.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> The spirit of the
olden faithfulness spoke in such words as, "Some put
their trust in chariots, and some in horses; but we will
trust in the name of the Lord our God." Solomon's<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
successors discovered that they had not gained in
strength by adopting this branch of military service in
their hilly and rocky land. They found that "a horse
is but a vain thing to save a man, neither shall he
deliver any man by his great strength."<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>For a time, however, Solomon's strenuous centralisation
was successful. His dominion extended, at least
nominally, from Tiphzah (Thapsacus), beside the ford
on the west bank of the Euphrates, to the Mediterranean;
over the whole domain of the Philistines; and
from Damascus to "the river of Egypt," that is, the
Rhinokolura or Wady el-Areesh. The names Jeroboam
and Rehoboam imply that they were born in an epoch
of prosperity.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> But the sequel proves that it was that

<p>After the destructive battle of Aphek, in which
the Philistines had defeated Israel, slain the two
sons of Eli, and taken captive the Ark of God, they
had inflicted a terrible vengeance on the old sanctuary
at Shiloh. They had burnt the young men in the fire,
and slain the priests with the sword, and no widows
were left to make lamentation.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> It is true that, terrified
by portents and diseases, the Philistines after a time
restored the Ark, and the Tabernacle of the wilderness
with its brazen altar still gave sacredness to the great
high place at Gibeon, to which apparently it had been
removed.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Nevertheless, the old worship seems to
have languished till it received a new and powerful
impulse from the religious earnestness of David. He
had the mind of a patriot-statesman as well as of a
soldier, and he felt that a nation is nothing without its
sacred memories. Those memories clustered round
the now-discredited Ark. Its capture, and its parade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
as a trophy of victory in the shrine of Dagon, had
robbed it of all its superstitious prestige as a fetish;
but, degraded as it had been, it still continued to be the
one inestimably precious historic relic which enshrined
the memories of the deliverance of Israel from Egypt,
and the dawn of its heroic age.</p>

<p>As soon as David had given to his people the boon
of a unique capital, nothing could be more natural than
the wish to add sacredness to the glory of the capital
by making it the centre of the national worship.
According to the Chronicles, David&mdash;feeling it a reproach
that he himself should dwell in palaces ceiled
with cedar and painted with vermilion while the Ark
of God dwelt between curtains&mdash;had made unheard-of
preparations to build a house for God. But it had
been decreed unfit that the sanctuary should be built
by a man whose hands were red with the blood of
many wars, and he had received the promise that the
great work should be accomplished by his son.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>Into that work Solomon threw himself with hearty
zeal in the month Zif<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> of the fourth year of his reign,
when his kingdom was consolidated.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> It commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
all his sympathies as an artist, a lover of magnificence,
and a ruler bent on the work of centralisation. It was
a task to which he was bound by the solemn exhortation
of his father, and he felt, doubtless, its political as well
as its religious importance. With his sincere desire to
build to God's glory was mingled a prophetic conviction
that his task would be fraught with immense issues for
the future of his people and of all the world. The
presence of the Temple left its impress on the very
name of Jerusalem. Although it has nothing to do with
the Temple or with Solomon, it became known to the
heathen world as Hierosolyma, which, as we see from
Eupolemos (Euseb., <i>Præp. Evang.</i>, ix. 34), the Gentile
world supposed to mean "the Temple (<i>Hieron</i>) of
Solomon."</p>

<p>The materials already provided were of priceless
value. David had consecrated to God the spoils which
he had won from conquered kings. We must reject,
as the exaggerations of national vanity, the monstrous
numbers which now stand in the text of the chronicler;
but a king whose court was simple and inexpensive
was quite able to amass treasures of gold and silver,
brass and iron, precious marbles and onyx stones.
Solomon had only to add to these sacred stores.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>He inherited the friendship which David had enjoyed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
with Hiram, King of Tyre, who, according to the
strange phrase of the Vatican Septuagint, sent his
servants "to anoint" Solomon. The friendliest overtures
passed between the two kings in letters, to which
Josephus appeals as still extant. A commercial treaty
was made by which Solomon engaged to furnish the
Tyrian king with annual revenues of wheat, barley, and
oil,<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> and Hiram put at Solomon's disposal the skilled
labour of an army of Sidonian wood-cutters and artisans.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
The huge trunks of cedar and cypress were sent
rushing down the heights of Lebanon by schlittage,
and laboriously dragged by road or river to the shore.
There they were constructed into immense rafts, which
were floated a hundred miles along the coast to Joppa,
where they were again dragged with enormous toil
for thirty-five miles up the steep and rocky roads to
Jerusalem. For more than twenty years, while Solomon
was building the Temple and his various royal constructions,
Jerusalem became a hive of ceaseless and varied
industry. Its ordinary inhabitants must have been
swelled by an army of Canaanite serfs and Ph&#339;nician
artisans to whom residences were assigned in Ophel.
There lived the hewers and bevellers of stone; the
cedar-cutters of Gebal or Biblos;<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> the cunning workmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
in gold or brass; the bronze-casters who made
their moulds in the clay ground of the Jordan valley;
the carvers and engravers; the dyers who stained wool
with the purple of the murex, and the scarlet dye of the
trumpet fish; the weavers and embroiderers of fine
linen. Every class of labourer was put into requisition,
from the descendants of the Gibeonite <i>Nethinim</i>,
who were rough hewers of wood and drawers of water,
to the trained artificers whose beautiful productions
were the wonder of the world. The "father," or
master-workman, of the whole community was a half-caste,
who also bore the name of Hiram, and was the
son of a woman of Naphtali by a Tyrian father.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>Some writers have tried to minimise Solomon's work
as a builder, and have spoken of the Temple as an
exceedingly insignificant structure which would not
stand a moment's comparison with the smallest and
humblest of our own cathedrals. Insignificant in size
it certainly was, but we must not forget its costly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
splendour, the remote age in which the work was
achieved, and the truly stupendous constructions which
the design required. Mount Moriah was selected as
a site hallowed by the tradition of Abraham's sacrifice,
and more recently by David's vision of the Angel of
the Pestilence with his drawn sword on the threshing-floor
of the Jebusite Prince Araunah.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> But to utilise
this doubly consecrated area involved almost superhuman
difficulties, which would have been avoided if
the loftier but less suitable height of the Mount of
Olives could have been chosen. The rugged summit
had to be enlarged to a space of five hundred yards
square, and this level was supported by Cyclopean
walls, which have long been the wonder of the world.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
The magnificent wall on the east side, known as "the
Jews' wailing-place," is doubtless the work of Solomon,
and after outlasting "the drums and tramplings of
a hundred triumphs," it remains to this day in uninjured
massiveness. One of the finely bevelled stones is 38&frac12;
feet long and 7 feet high, and weighs more than 100
tons. These vast stones were hewn from a quarry
above the level of the wall, and lowered by rollers down
an inclined plane. Part of the old wall rises 30 feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
above the present level of the soil, but a far larger part
of the height lies hidden 80 feet under the accumulated
<i>débris</i> of the often captured city. At the south-west angle,
by Robinson's arch, three pavements were discovered,
one beneath the other, showing the gradual filling up
of the valley; and on the lowest of these were found
the broken <i>voussoirs</i> of the arch. In Solomon's day
the whole of this mighty wall was visible. On one of
the lowest stones have been discovered the Ph&#339;nician
paint-marks which indicated where each of the huge
masses, so carefully dressed, edge-drafted, and bevelled,
was to be placed in the structure. The caverns, quarries,
water storages, and subterranean conduits hewn out of
the solid rock, over which Jerusalem is built, could only
have been constructed at the cost of immeasurable toil.
They would be wonderful even with our infinitely more
rapid methods and more powerful agencies; but when
we remember that they were made three thousand
years ago we do not wonder that their massiveness has
haunted the imagination of so many myriads of visitors
from every nation.</p>

<p>It was perhaps from his Egyptian father-in-law that
Solomon, to his own cost, learnt the secret of forced
labour which alone rendered such undertakings possible.
In their Egyptian bondage the forefathers of Israel had
been fatally familiar with the ugly word <i>Mas</i>, the
labour wrung from them by hard task-masters.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> In
the reign of Solomon it once more became only too
common on the lips of the burdened people.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>Four classes were subject to it.</p>

<p>1. The lightest labour was required from the native
freeborn Israelites (<i>ezrach</i>). They were not regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
as bondsmen (&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1464;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;), yet 30,000 of these were required
in relays of 10,000 to work, one month in every three,
in the forest of Lebanon.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>2. There were the strangers, or resident aliens
(<i>Gerim</i>), such as the Ph&#339;nicians and Giblites, who
were Hiram's subjects and worked for pay.</p>

<p>3. There were three classes of slaves&mdash;those taken
in war, or sold for debt, or home-born.</p>

<p>4. Lowest and most wretched of all, there were the
vassal Canaanites (<i>Toshabim</i>), from whom were drawn
those 70,000 burden-bearers, and 80,000 quarry-men,
the Helots of Palestine, who were placed under the
charge of 3600 Israelite officers. The blotches of
smoke are still visible on the walls and roofs of the
subterranean quarries where these poor serfs, in the
dim torchlight and suffocating air, "laboured without
reward, perished without pity, and suffered without
redress." The sad narrative reveals to us, and modern
research confirms, that the purple of Solomon had a
very seamy side, and that an abyss of misery heaved
and moaned under the glittering surface of his splendour.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
Jerusalem during the twenty years occupied
by his building must have presented the disastrous
spectacle of task-masters, armed with rods and scourges,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
enforcing the toil of gangs of slaves, as we see them
represented on the tombs of Egypt and the palaces of
Assyria. The sequel shows the jealousies and discontents
even of the native Israelites, who felt themselves
to be "scourged with whips and laden with
heavy burdens." They were bondmen in all but name,
for purposes which bore very little on their own welfare.
But the curses of the wretched aborigines must have
been deeper, if not so loud. They were torn from such
homes as the despotism of conquest still left to them,
and were forced to hopeless and unrewarded toil for
the alien worship and hateful palaces of their masters.
Five centuries later we find a pitiable trace of their
existence in the 392 <i>Hierodouloi</i>, menials lower even
than the enslaved <i>Nethinim</i>, who are called "<i>sons of
the slaves of Solomon</i>"&mdash;the dwindling and miserable
remnant of that vast levy of Palestinian serfs.</p>

<p>Apart from the lavish costliness of its materials the
actual Temple was architecturally a poor and commonplace
structure. It was quite small&mdash;only 90 feet long,
35 feet broad, and 45 feet high. It was meant for the
symbolic habitation of God, not for the worship of
great congregations. It only represented the nascent art
and limited resources of a tenth-rate kingdom, and was
totally devoid alike of the pure and stately beauty of the
Parthenon and the awe-inspiring grandeur of the great
Egyptian temples with their avenues of obelisks and
sphinxes and their colossal statues of deities and kings</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Staring right on with calm, eternal eyes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When Justinian boastfully exclaimed, as he looked at
his church, "<i>I have vanquished thee, O Solomon</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
when the Khalif Omar, pointing to the Dome of the
Rock, murmured, "<i>Behold, a greater than Solomon is
here,</i>" they forgot the vast differences between them
and the Jewish king in the epoch at which they lived
and the resources which they could command. The
Temple was built in "majestic silence."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No workman's axe, no ponderous hammer rung,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like some tall palm the noiseless fabric sprung."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This was due to religious reverence. It could be
easily accomplished, because each stone and beam was
carefully prepared to be fitted in its exact place before
it was carried up the Temple hill.</p>

<p>The elaborate particulars furnished us of the measurements
of Solomon's Temple are too late in age, too
divergent in particulars, too loosely strung together,
too much mingled with later reminiscences, and altogether
too architecturally insufficient, to enable us to
re-construct the exact building, or even to form more
than a vague conception of its external appearance.
Both in Kings and Chronicles the notices, as Keil says,
are "incomplete extracts made independently of one
another," and vague in essential details. Critics and
architects have attempted to reproduce the Temple on
Greek,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Egyptian,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> and Ph&#339;nician<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> models, so entirely
unlike each other as to show that we can arrive at no
certainty.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> It is, however, most probable that, alike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
in ornamentation and conception, the building was
predominantly Ph&#339;nician.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Severe in outline, gorgeous
in detail, it was more like the Temple of Venus-Astarte
at Paphos than any other. Fortunately the details,
apart from such dim symbolism as we may detect in
them, have no religious importance, but only an historic
and antiquarian interest.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>The Temple&mdash;called <i>Baith</i> (&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1514;) or <i>Hêkâl</i> (&#1492;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;)&mdash;was
surrounded by the thickly clustered houses of the
Levites, and by porticoes<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> through which the precincts
were entered by numerous gates of wood overlaid with
brass. A grove of olives, palms, cedars, and cypresses,
the home of many birds, probably adorned the outer
court.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> This court was shut from the "higher court,"<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
afterwards known as "the Court of the Priests," by a
partition of three rows of hewn stones surmounted by
a cornice of cedar beams. In the higher court, which
was reached by a flight of steps, was the vast new
altar of brass, 15 feet high and 30 feet long, of which
the hollow was filled with earth and stones, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
which the blazing sacrifices were visible in the court
below.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Here also stood the huge molten sea, borne
on the backs of twelve brazen oxen, of which three
faced to each quarter of the heavens.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> It was in the
form of a lotus blossom, and its rim was hung with
three hundred wild gourds in bronze, cast in two rows.
Its reservoir of eight hundred and eighty gallons of
water was for the priestly ablutions necessary in the
butcheries of sacrifice, and its usefulness was supplemented
by ten brazen caldrons on wheels, five on
each side, adorned like "the sea," with pensile garlands
and cherubic emblems.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Whether "the brazen serpent
of the wilderness," to which the children of Israel
burnt incense down to the days of Hezekiah, was in
that court or in the Temple we do not know.</p>

<p>On the western side of this court, facing the rising
sun, stood the Temple itself, on a platform elevated
some sixteen feet from the ground. Its side chambers
were "lean-to" annexes (Heb., ribs; LXX., &#956;&#8051;&#955;&#945;&#952;&#961;&#945;;
Vulg., <i>tabulata</i>), in three stories, all accessible by one
central entrance on the outside. Their beams rested
on rebatements in the thickness of the wall, and the
highest was the broadest. Above these were windows
"skewed and closed," as the margin of the A.V.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
says; or "broad within and narrow without"; or, as
it should rather be rendered, "with closed crossbeams,"
that is, with immovable lattices, which could
not be opened and shut, but which allowed the escape
of the smoke of lamps and the fumes of incense.
These chambers must also have had windows. They
were used to store the garments of the priests and
other necessary paraphernalia of the Temple service,
but as to all details we are left completely in the dark.</p>

<p>Of the external aspect of the building in Solomon's
day we know nothing. We cannot even tell whether
it had one level roof, or whether the Holy of Holies was
like a lower chancel at the end of it; nor whether the
roof was flat or, as the Rabbis say, ridged; nor whether
the outer surface of the three-storeyed chambers which
surrounded it was of stone, or planked with cedar, or
overlaid with plinths of gold and silver;<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> nor whether,
in any case, it was ornamented with carvings or left
blank; nor whether the cornices only were decorated
with open flowers like the Assyrian rosettes. Nor do
we know with certainty whether it was supported
within by pillars<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> or not. In the state of the records
as they have come down to us, all accurate or intelligible
descriptions are slurred over by compilers who
had no technical knowledge and whose main desire was
to impress their countrymen with the truth that the
holy building was&mdash;as indeed for its day it was&mdash;"exceeding
magnifical of fame and of glory throughout
all countries."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>In front of or just within the porch were two superb
pillars, regarded as miracles of Tyrian art, made of fluted
bronze, 27 feet high and 18 feet thick. Their capitals
of 7&frac12; feet in height resembled an open lotos blossom,
surrounded by double wreaths of two hundred pensile
bronze pomegranates, supporting an abacus, carved
with conventional lily work. Both pomegranates and
lilies had a symbolic meaning.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> The pillars were, for
unknown reasons, called Jachin and Boaz.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Much
about them is obscure. It is not even known whether
they stood detached like obelisks, or formed Propylæa;
or supported the architraves of the porch itself, or
were a sort of gateway, surmounted by a <i>melathron</i>
with two <i>epithemas</i>, like a Japanese or Indian <i>toran</i>.</p>

<p>The porch (<i>Olam</i>), which was of the same height as
the house (<i>i.e.</i>, 45 feet high),<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> was hung with the gilded
shields of Hadadezer's soldiers which David had taken
in battle,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> and perhaps also with consecrated armour,
like the sword of Goliath,<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> to show that "unto the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
belongeth our shield" (Psalm lxxxix. 18), and that
"the shields of the earth belong unto God" (Psalm
xlvii. 9).</p>

<p>A door of cypress wood, of two leaves, made in four
squares, 7&frac12; feet broad and high, turning on golden
hinges overlaid with gold, and carved with palm
branches and festoons of lilies and pomegranates,
opened from the porch into the main apartment. This
was the <i>Mikdash</i> (&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;), Holy Place, or Sanctuary, and
sometimes specially called in Chaldee "the Palace"
(<i>Hêkâl</i>, or <i>Bîrah</i>) (Ezra v, 14, 15, etc.). Before it, as in
the Tabernacle, hung an embroidered curtain (<i>M&#257;sak</i>).
It was probably supported by four pillars on each side.
In the interspaces were five tables on each side, overlaid
with gold, and each encircled by a wreath of gold
(<i>zêr</i>). On these were placed the cakes of shewbread.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
At the end of the chamber, on each side the door of the
Holiest, were five golden candlesticks with chains of
wreathed gold hanging between them. In the centre
of the room stood the golden altar of incense, and
somewhere (we must suppose) the golden candlestick
of the Tabernacle, with its seven branches ornamented
with lilies, pomegranates, and calices of almond flowers.
Nothing which was in the darkness of the Holiest was
visible except the projecting golden staves with which
the Ark had been carried to its place. The Holy Place
itself was lighted by narrow slits.</p>

<p>The entrance to the Holiest, the <i>Debir</i>, or oracle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
which corresponded to the Greek <i>adytum</i>, was through
a two-leaved door of olive wood, 6 feet high and
broad, overlaid with gold, and carved with palms, cherubim,
and open flowers. The partition was of cedar
wood. The floor of the whole house was of cedar
overlaid with gold. The interior of this "Oracle," as
it was called&mdash;for the title "Holy of Holies" is of later
origin&mdash;was, at any rate in the later Temples, concealed
by an embroidered veil of blue, purple, and crimson,
looped up with golden chains.</p>

<p>The Oracle, like the New Jerusalem of the Apocalypse,
was a perfect cube, 30 feet broad and long and
high, covered with gold, but shrouded in perpetual
and unbroken darkness.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> No light was ever visible in
it save such as was shed by the crimson gleam of the
thurible of incense which the high priest carried into
it once a year on the Great Day of Atonement.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> In the
centre of the floor must apparently have risen the mass
of rock which is still visible in the Mosque of Omar,
from which it is called <i>Al Sakhra</i>, "the Dome of the
Rock." Tradition pointed to it as the spot on which
Abraham had laid for sacrifice the body of his son
Isaac, when the angel restrained the descending knife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
It was also the site of Araunah's threshing-floor, and
had been therefore hallowed by two angelic apparitions.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
On it was deposited with solemn ceremony the awful
palladium of the Ark, which had been preserved through
the wanderings and wars of the Exodus and the troublous
days of the Judges.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> It contained the most sacred
possession of the nation, the most priceless treasure
which Israel guarded for the world. This treasure was
the Two Tables of the Ten Commandments, graven (in
the anthropomorphic language of the ancient record) by
the actual finger of God; the tables which Moses had
shattered on the rocks of Mount Sinai as he descended
to the backsliding people.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> The Ark was covered with
its old "Propitiatory," or "Mercy-seat," overshadowed
by the wings of two small cherubim; but Solomon had
prepared for its reception a new and far more magnificent
covering, in the form of two colossal cherubim,
15 feet high, of which each expanded wing was 7&frac12; feet
long. These wings touched the outer walls of the
Oracle, and also touched each other over the centre
of the Ark.</p>

<p>Such was the Temple.</p>

<p>It was the "forum, fortress, university, and sanctuary"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
of the Jews, and the transitory emblem of the Church
of Christ's kingdom. It was destined to occupy a
large share in the memory, and even in the religious
development, of the world, because it became the central
point round which crystallised the entire history of the
Chosen People. The kings of Judah are henceforth
estimated with almost exclusive reference to the relation
in which they stood to the centralised worship of
Jehovah. The Spanish kings who built and decorated
the Escurial caught the spirit of Jewish annals
when, in the Court of the Kings, they reared the six
colossal statues of David the originator, of Solomon
the founder, of Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, Josiah, and
Manasseh the restorers or purifiers of the Temple
worship.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>It required the toil of 300,000 men for twenty years to
build one of the pyramids. It took two hundred years
to build and four hundred to embellish the great Temple
of Artemis of the Ephesians. It took more than five
centuries to give to Westminster Abbey its present form.
Solomon's Temple only took seven and a half years to
build; but, as we shall see, its objects were wholly
different from those of the great shrines which we have
mentioned. The wealth lavished upon it was such that
its dishes, bowls, cups, even its snuffers and snuffer
trays, and its meanest utensils, were of pure gold. The
massiveness of its substructions, the splendour of its
materials, the artistic skill displayed by the Tyrian workmen
in all its details and adornments, added to the awful
sense of its indwelling Deity, gave it an imperishable
fame. Needing but little repair, it stood for more than
four centuries. Succeeded as it was by the Temples of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Zerubbabel and of Herod, it carried down till seventy
years after the Christian era the memory of the Tabernacle
in the wilderness, of which it preserved the
general outline, though it exactly doubled all the proportions
and admitted many innovations.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>The dedication ceremony was carried out with the
utmost pomp. It required nearly a year to complete
the necessary preparations, and the ceremony with its
feasts occupied fourteen days, which were partly
coincident with the autumn Feast of Tabernacles.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>The dedication falls into three great acts. The first
was the removal of the Ark to its new home (1 Kings
viii. 1-11); then followed the speech and the prayer of
Solomon (vv. 12-61); and, finally, the great holocaust
was offered (vv. 62-66).</p>

<p>The old Tabernacle, or what remained of it, with its
precious heirlooms, was carried by priests and Levites
from the high place at Gibeon, which was henceforth
abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> This procession was met by another, far
more numerous and splendid, consisting of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
princes, nobles, and captains, which brought the Ark
from the tent erected for it on Mount Zion by David
forty years before.</p>

<p>The Israelites had flocked to Jerusalem in countless
multitudes, under their sheykhs and emîrs<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> from the
border of Hamath on the Orontes,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> north of Mount
Lebanon, to the Wady el-Areesh.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> The king, in his
most regal state, accompanied the procession, and the
Ark passed through myriads of worshippers crowded
in the outer court, from the tent on Mount Zion into
the darkness of the Oracle on Mount Moriah, where it
continued, unseen perhaps by any human eye but that
of the high priest once a year, until it was carried
away by Nebuchadnezzar to Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> To indicate
that this was to be its rest for ever, the staves, contrary
to the old law, were drawn out of the golden rings
through which they ran, in order that no human hand
might touch the sacred emblem itself when it was borne
on the shoulders of the Levitic priests. "And there
they are unto this day," writes the compiler from his
ancient record, long after Temple and Ark had ceased
to exist.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>The king is the one predominant figure, and the
high priest is not once mentioned. Nathan is only
mentioned by the heathen historian Eupolemos. Visible
to the whole vast multitude, Solomon stood in the inner
court on a high scaffolding of brass. Then came a
burst of music and psalmody from the priests and
musicians, robed in white robes, who densely thronged
the steps of the great altar.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> They held in their hands
their glittering harps and cymbals, and psalteries in
their precious frames of red sandal wood, and twelve of
their number rent the air with the blast of their silver
trumpets as Solomon, in this supreme hour of his
prosperity, shone forth before his people in all his
manly beauty.</p>

<p>At the sight of that stately figure in its gorgeous
robes the song of praise was swelled by innumerable
voices, and, to crown all, a blaze of sudden glory
wrapped the Temple and the whole scene in heaven's own
splendour (2 Chron. v. 13, 14). First, the king, standing
with his back to the people, broke out into a few words
of prophetic song. Then, turning to the multitude, he
blessed them&mdash;he, and not the high priest&mdash;and briefly
told them the history and significance of this house of
God, warning them faithfully that the Temple after all
was but the <i>emblem</i> of God's presence in the midst of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
them, and that the Most High dwelleth not in temples
made with hands, neither is worshipped with men's
hands as though He needed anything. After this he
advanced to the altar, and kneeling on his knees
(2 Chron. vi. 13)&mdash;a most unusual attitude among the
Jews, who, down to the latest ages, usually stood up to
pray&mdash;he prayed with the palms of his hands upturned
to heaven, as though to receive in deep humility its outpoured
benefits. The prayer, as here given, consists
of an introduction, seven petitions, and a conclusion.
It was a passionate entreaty that God would hear, both
individually and nationally, both in prosperity and in
adversity, the supplications of His people, and even of
strangers, who should either pray in the courts of that
His house, or should make it the <i>Kibleh</i> of their
devotions.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>After the dedicatory prayer both the outer and the
inner court of the Temple reeked and swam with the
blood of countless victims&mdash;victims so numerous that
the great brazen altar became wholly insufficient for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
them.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> At the close of the entire festival they departed
to their homes with joy and gladness.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>But whatever the Temple might or might not be to
the people, the king used it as his own chapel. Three
times a year, we are told, he offered&mdash;and for all that
appears, offered with his own hand without the intervention
of any priest&mdash;burnt offerings and peace
offerings upon the altar. Not only this, but he actually
"burnt incense therewith upon the altar which was
before the Lord,"&mdash;the very thing which was regarded
as so deadly a crime in the case of King Uzziah.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
Throughout the history of the monarchy, the priests,
with scarcely any exception, seem to have been passive
tools in the hands of the kings. Even under Rehoboam&mdash;much
more under Ahaz and Manasseh&mdash;the sacred
precincts were defiled with nameless abominations, to
which, so far as we know, the priests offered no
resistance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE IDEAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TEMPLE.</i></h3>

<p class="center">1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> vii. 13-51, viii. 12-61.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet
at Jerusalem, worship the Father.... But the hour cometh, and now
is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and
in truth."&mdash;<span class="smcap">John</span> iv. 21, 23.</p></blockquote>


<p>Five long chapters of the First Book of Kings are
devoted to the description of Solomon's Temple,
which occupies a still larger space in the Books of
Chronicles. The Temple was regarded as the permanent
form of the ancient Tabernacle,<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> which is
described with lengthy and minute detail in Exodus.
It might seem, therefore, that there must be some clear
explanation of the idea which this sacred building was
intended to embody. Yet it is by no means easy to
ascertain what this idea was, and those who have
deeply studied the question have in age after age been
led to widely different views.</p>

<p>1. Philo and Josephus,<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> with certain variations of
detail, regard it as a symbol of the universe&mdash;the world
of idea and the world of sense. Thus the seven-branched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
candlestick represents the seven planets; the
twelve cakes of shewbread are the twelve signs of the
Zodiac; the court is the earth; the sanctuary the sea;
and the oracle the heavens. The theory derives no
importance from its authorship. Neither Philo nor
Josephus, nor the Rabbis, nor the Fathers who adopted
their views,<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> have the least authority in such matters;
and Philo, who led the way in mystical interpretation,
abounds in fantasies which are ludicrously impossible,
and are now universally rejected.</p>

<p>2. The Talmudists held that the Tabernacle was the
exact copy of one in heaven,<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> and that its services
reflected those of the heavenly hierarchy. This view
went into the extreme of literalism, as the other did
into the extreme of spiritualisation. It was based on the
text, "Look that thou make them after their pattern,
which was showed thee in the mount."<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> The Book of
Chronicles goes so far in this direction as to say that
David received from Jehovah the exact pattern of the
Temple down to its minutest details, together with the
entire priestly and Levitic organisation of its services.
"All this," says David to Solomon, "the Lord made
me to understand <i>in writing</i>, by His hand upon me,
even all the works in the pattern."</p>

<p>3. Christian writers have seen in the Temple an
emblem of the visible, the invisible, and the triumphant
Church. Such symbolic interpretation depends on the
most arbitrary combinations, and does not rise higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
than an exercise of fancy. It has not the smallest
exegetic importance.</p>

<p>4. Luther thought that the Tabernacle and Temple
were emblems of human nature:&mdash;the court, the
sanctuary, and the oracle corresponding to the body,
the soul, and the spirit. Later writers have pushed
this opinion, already sufficiently baseless, into the
absurdest detail.</p>

<p>5. The much simpler view of Maimonides<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> who is
followed by our learned Spencer, is that the Temple
was simply the palace of Jehovah, with its vestibule,
its audience hall, its Presence-chamber, its attendant
courtiers, its throne, and its offerings of food and wine
and sacrifice. The simplicity of this conception seems
to be in accordance with what we know of ancient
forms of worship, and it is certain that in many heathen
temples the offerings of food and wine were supposed
to be consumed by the god. The name "palace" is,
however, only given to the Temple in one chapter
(1 Chron. xxix. 1, 19); and the Hebrew, or rather the
Persian,<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> word so rendered (<i>bîrah</i>) may also be rendered
"fortress."</p>

<p>6. In truth we cannot be sure that the idea of the
Temple remained single and definite through so many
ages. It was probably a composite and varying emblem,
of which the original significance had become mingled
with many later elements. It is, however, certain that
many numbers and details were symbolical, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
was a deep insight and magnificent completeness in the
manner in which certain truths were shadowed forth
by its construction and its central service.</p>

<p>The book in which its symbolism is most thoroughly
worked out is Bähr's <i>Symbolik</i>. He elaborates, in a
simpler form, the opinion of Philo, that the Temple
represented "the structure which God has erected, the
house in which God lives." So far the fact cannot be
disputed for, in Exod. xxix. 45 we are told that the
Tabernacle is called the "House of God" because "I
will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and
will be their God." But Bähr takes a great leap when
he proceeds to explain the house of God as "the
creation of heaven and earth." If his views were true
<i>as a whole</i>, it would indeed be strange that they are
not indicated in a single passage either of the Old or
New Testaments.</p>

<p>The Tabernacle was called "the Tabernacle of the
Testimony" because its two tables of stone were a
witness of the covenant between God and man. It
was also called "the Tabernacle of Meeting," by which
is not meant the place where Israel assembled, but the
place where God met Moses and the children of Israel.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>
"For there will I meet with thee, and I will commune
with thee from above the mercy-seat," says Jehovah
to Moses;<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> and "at the entrance of the tent of meeting
I will meet with you to speak there unto thee, and
there I will meet with the children of Israel."<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Thus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
in its broadest idea, the Temple brought before the
soul of every thoughtful Israelite the three great beliefs,
(1) that God deigned to dwell in the midst of His
people; (2) that, in His infinite mercy and condescension,
He admitted a reciprocity between Himself
and His human children; and (3) that the most
absolute expression of His will was the moral law,
obedience to which was the condition of heavenly
favour and earthly happiness.</p>

<p>"In the Porch," says Bishop Hall, "we may see the
regenerate soul entering into the blessed society of the
Church; in the Holy Place we may see a figure of
the Communion of the true visible Church on earth;
in the Holy of Holies the glories of Heaven opened to
us by our true High Priest Christ Jesus, who entered
once for all to make an Atonement betwixt God and
man."</p>

<p>The inculcation of truths so deep as the unity,
the presence, and the mercy of God would alone
have sufficed to give preciousness to the national
sanctuary, and to justify the lavish expenditure with
which it was carried to completion. But as in the
Tabernacle, so in the Temple, which was only a more
rich and permanent structure, the numbers, the colours,
and many details had a real significance. The unity
of the Temple shadowed forth the unity of the Godhead;
while the concrete and perfect unity, resulting from the
reconciliation of unity with difference and opposition
(1 + 2), is "the signature of the Deity." Hence, as in
our English cathedrals, three was the predominant number.
There were three divisions,&mdash;Porch, Holy Place,
Oracle. Each main division contained three expiatory
objects. Three times its width (which was 3 × 10)
was the measure of its length. The number ten
is also prominent in the measurements. It includes
all the cardinal numbers, and, as the completion of
multiplicity, is used to indicate a perfect whole. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
seven pillars which supported the house, and the seven
branches of the candlestick, recalled the sacredness of
the seventh day hallowed by the Sabbath, by circumcision,
and by the Passover. The number of the cakes
of shewbread was twelve, "the signature of the people
of Israel, a whole in the midst of which God resides,
a body which moves after Divine laws." Of the colours
predominant in the Temple, <i>blue</i>, the colour of heaven,
symbolises revelation; <i>white</i> is the colour of light and
innocence; <i>purple</i>, of majesty and royal power; <i>crimson</i>,
of life, being the colour of fire and blood. Every gem
on the high priest's pectoral had its mystic significance,
and the bells and pomegranates which fringed the edge
of his ephod were emblems of devotion and good works.</p>

<p>Two instances will suffice to indicate how deep and
rich was the significance of the truths which Moses
had endeavoured to engraft in the minds of his people,
and to which Solomon, whether with full consciousness
or not, gave permanence in the Temple.</p>

<p>1. Consider, first, <i>the Ark</i>.</p>

<p>Every step towards the Holiest was a step of deepening
reverence. The Holy Land was sacred, but
Jerusalem was more sacred than all the rest. The
Temple was the most sacred part of the city; the Oracle
was the most sacred part of the Temple; the Ark was
the most sacred thing in the Oracle; yet the Ark was
only sacred because of that which it contained.</p>

<p>And what did it contain? What was it which
enshrined in itself this quintessence of all sanctitude?
When we pierce to the inmost recesses of a pyramid,
we find there only the ashes of a dead man, or even
of an animal. Within the adytum of an Egyptian
temple we might have found "an ox wallowing on
purple tapestry." The Egyptians, too, had their arks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
as the Greeks had the cyst of Cybele, and the <i>vannus</i>
of Iacchus. What did <i>they</i> contain? At the best
phallic emblems, the emblems of prolific nature. But
the Ark of Jehovah contained nothing but the stone
tablets on which were carved the Ten Words of the
Covenant, the briefest possible form of the moral law
of God. In the inmost heart of the Temple was its most
inestimable treasure,&mdash;a protest against all idolatry; a
protest against all polytheism, or ditheism, or atheism;
a protest, too, against the formalism which the Temple
itself and its services might tend to produce in its
least spiritually minded worshippers. Thus the entire
Temple was a glorification of the truth that "the fear
of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom," and that
the one end to be produced by the fear of the Lord
is obedience to His commandments. The Ark and
its unseen treasure taught that no religion can be
of the least value which does not result in conformity
with the plain moral laws:&mdash;Be obedient; be kind;
be pure; be honest; be truthful; be contented; and
that this obedience can only spring from faith in the
one God whom all real worshippers must worship
in spirit and truth.</p>

<p>Obvious as this lesson might seem to be, it was
entirely missed by the Jews in general. The Ark, too,
was degraded into a fetish, and Jeremiah says (iii. 16)
of the exiles, "They shall say no more, The ark of
the covenant of the Lord: neither shall it come to
mind: neither shall they miss it: neither shall it be
made any more" (Heb.). When a symbol has been
perverted into a source of materialism and superstition,
it becomes not only useless but positively dangerous.
No religions have fallen so absolutely dead as those
which have sunk into petty formalism. The Ark, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
all its quintessential sacredness, had been suffered to
fall into the hands of uncircumcised Philistines, and to
be placed in their Dagon temple, to show that it was
no mere idolatrous amulet. Ultimately it was carried
away to Babylon, to adorn the palace of a heathen
tyrant, and probably to perish by fire in his captured
city. In the second Temple there was no ark. Nothing
remained but the rock of Araunah's threshing-floor, on
which it once had stood.</p>

<p>2. Consider, next, the meaning of <i>the Cherubim</i>.</p>

<p>(1) The infinite sanctity given to the conception of the
moral law was enhanced by the introduction of these
overshadowing figures. We are never told in the
entire books of Scripture what was the form of these
cherubim; nor is their function anywhere specially
defined; nor, again, can we be at all certain of the
derivation of the name. That the cherubim over the
Ark were not identical with the fourfold-visaged four
of Ezekiel's cherub-chariot we know, because they
certainly had but one face. But we now know that
among the Assyrians, Persians, Egyptians, and other
nations nothing was more common than these cherubic
emblems, which were introduced into their palaces and
temples under the forms of winged lions, oxen, men,
and eagle-headed human figures. We see also that in
the Tabernacle,<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> and to a still greater extent in the
Temple, a tacit exception to the stringency of the
Second Commandment seems to have been made in
favour of the component parts of these cherubic figures.
If Solomon was aware (as he surely must have been)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
of the existence of the law, "<i>Thou shalt not make to
thyself any graven image</i>," he must either have laid
stress on the words "<i>to thyself</i>," and have excused the
brazen oxen which supported his great laver on the
ground that they could not be turned into objects of
worship, or he must have held, as Ezekiel apparently
did, that the ox was the predominant form in the
cherubic emblem.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> From the Vision of Ezekiel we see
that the cherubim&mdash;like the "Immortalities" (&#950;&#8182;&#945;) of
the Apocalypse, which had faces of the ox, the eagle,
the lion, and the man&mdash;were conceived of as "living
creatures" upholding the sapphire Throne of God.
They had wings, and the similitude of hands under
their wings. They flashed to and fro like lightning in
the midst of a great cloud, and an enfolding fire, and a
rolling mass of amber-coloured flame. Of the form of
this "changeable hieroglyphic" we need say no more.
Perhaps originally suggested by the wreathing fires
and rolling stormclouds, which were regarded as
immediate signs of the Divine proximity, the cherubim
came to be regarded as the genius of the created
universe in its richest perfection and energy, at once
revealing and shrouding the Presence of God.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Their
eyes represent His omniscience, for "the eyes of the
Lord are in every place"; their wings and straight
feet represent the speed and fiery gliding of His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
omnipresence;<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> each element of their fourfold shape
indicates His love, His patience, His power, His
sublimity. Their wheels imply that "the dread magnificence
of the unintelligent creation" is under His
entire control; and, as a whole, they symbolise the
dazzling beauty of the universe, alike conscious and
material. They were the ideal <i>anima animantium</i>&mdash;the
perfection of existence emanating from and subject to
the Divine Creator whose tender mercy is over all His
works. Their function, when they are first introduced
in the Book of Genesis, is at once vengeful and protective;
vengeful of the violated law, protective of the
treasure of life.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> They are here the Erinnyes of the
Dawn, revealing and avenging the works of darkness.
Their "dreadful faces and fiery arms" at the gate of
Eden typify guilty awakenment, realised retribution,
conscious alienation from God, the universe siding
with His awakened anger.</p>

<p>(2) But when next they are mentioned, God says
to Moses, "Thou shalt make a mercy-seat of pure gold,
and thou shalt make two cherubim of gold at the two
ends of the mercy-seat." But for their presence on
the mercy-seat how terrible would have been the
symbolism of the Holy of Holies&mdash;God's darkness,
man's crime, a broken law! It would have represented
Him who hath clouds and darkness round about Him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
and dwelleth in darkness which no man can approach
unto; and the Ark would only have treasured up, as
a witness against man's apostasy, the shattered slabs
of the words of Sinai.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> But over that Ark, and its
saddening because dishallowed treasure, bent once
more these mystic figures, these "cherubim of glory."
They bent down as though at once to protect with
outspread wings, and to regard with awful contemplation,
that mystic gift of a law promulgated to all
nations as their moral heritage and as the revealed
will of God. These are no longer cherubim of vengeance
or awakened wrath, for they stand on the <i>Capporeth</i>,
the "covering," or "propitiatory" of the Ark.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> They
gleamed out in the red light of the high priest's golden
brazier on the one day when human foot entered the
darkness in which they were shrouded; and even by
him they were but dimly discerned through the ascending
wreaths of fragrant incense. But he stood before
them, where, on their spreading wings, the light of the
Divine presence was deemed to dwell; and with the
blood of expiation he sprinkled seven times the mercy-seat
over which these adoring figures leaned. The
wrathful cherubim of the lost Eden had driven man
from a treasure which he had forfeited; but these,
though they guard the ten words of a law which man
had broken, were cherubim of mercy and reconciliation.
Those of Eden were armed with swords of flame;
those of the Temple were reddened with the blood of
forgiveness. Those typified a covenant destroyed and
ended; these a covenant broken yet renewed. Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
spoke of awakened wrath; these of covenanted mercy.
Those kept men back from the Tree of Life; these
guarded that which is a Tree of Life to them that
love it.</p>

<p>Could the whole covenant of the law and the gospel
have been symbolised more simply, yet with Diviner
force? The Temple itself, with all its sacrifices, with
all its service and ceremonial and all the gorgeous
vestments of Aaron's vestry, served but to teach the
infinite worth of simple righteousness. The heart of
the Mosaic legislation was nothing so poor, so paltry,
so material as the promotion of liturgical Levitism, and
the pomp of ritual, and the organisation of priestly
functions&mdash;as though these in themselves had any value
in the sight of God. It lay in the lesson that "Obedience
is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the
fat of rams." The law of Moses&mdash;the ten words which
constituted the inmost preciousness of his legislation&mdash;was,
alas! a violated law. For the disobedient it had
no message but the wrathful menace of death. But
to show that God has not abandoned His disobedient
children, but would still enable them to keep that law,
and to repent for its transgression, the cherubim are
there. Their presence on the propitiatory was meant
to reveal the glory of the gospel. The high priest,
who alone saw them on the Great Day of Israel, was
a type of Him who, not with the blood of bulls and
goats, but in His own blood (<i>i.e.</i>, in the glory of the
life outpoured for man), entered into God's presence
within the veil.</p>

<p>(3) In the dazzling living creatures before the throne
in the Revelation of St. John, we see once more these
cherubim of Eden, who, having indicated at the Fall
an awful warning, and represented in the Tabernacle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
a blessed hope, symbolise, in the last book of the Bible,
a Divine fulfilment. They are there no longer with
fiery swords, in wrathful aspect, in repellent silence;
but, gracious and beautiful, they join in the new song
of the redeemed multitude under the shadow of the
Tree of Life, to which all have free access in that
recovered Eden. In the Temple&mdash;glimmering through
the rising fumes of incense, which were the type of
accepted prayer, their golden plumage sprinkled with
the blood of the atoning sacrifice&mdash;they became a type
both of all creation, up to its most celestial beings,
gazing in adoration on the will of God, and of all
creation, in its groaning and travailing, restored through
the precious blood that speaketh better things than the
blood of Abel. Not all, of course, of these deep meanings
were present to the souls of Israel's worshippers;
but the best of them might with joy see something of
the things which we see when we say that in these
glorious figures are summed up the three chief images
of all Scripture: first, the Primæval Dispensation, "<i>In
the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die</i>";
next, in the wilderness, "<i>This do, and thou shalt live</i>";
last of all, in the Gospel Dispensation, "<i>Thou wast
slain, and hast redeemed us to God by Thy blood out of
every kindred and tongue and people and nation, and
hast made us unto our God kings and priests.</i>"</p>

<h3><i>THE GRADUAL GROWTH OF THE LEVITIC RITUAL.</i></h3>

<p class="center">1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> viii. 1-66.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice."&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Sam.</span> xv. 22.</p></blockquote>


<p>Before we enter on the subject of the Temple
worship, it is necessary to emphasise a fact which
will meet us again and again in many forms as we
consider the history of the Chosen People: it is the
amazing ignorance which seems to have prevailed
among them for centuries as to the most central and
decisive elements of nearly the whole of the Mosaic
law as we now read it in the Pentateuch.</p>

<p>1. Take, for instance, the law of a central sanctuary.
It is strongly laid down, and incessantly insisted on,
throughout the Book of Deuteronomy.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Yet that law
does not seem to have been so much as noticed by any
of the earlier prophets or judges, or by Saul, or by
David. The judges and early kings offer sacrifices at
any place which they regard as sacred&mdash;Bochim, Ophrah,
Mizpeh, Gilgal, Bethel, Bethlehem, etc.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> The rule of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
one place for sacrifice was not regarded for a moment
by the kings of the Northern Kingdom. The transgression
of it was not made a subject of complaint by Elijah,
Elisha, or any of the earlier prophets. Not one of the
kings, even of the most pious kings&mdash;Asa, Jehoshaphat,
Joash, Amaziah, Uzziah, Jotham&mdash;rigidly enforced it
until the reign of Josiah. The law seems to have
remained an absolutely dead letter for hundreds of
years. Now this would be amply accounted for if
the Deuteronomic and Levitic Codes only belonged in
reality to the days of Josiah and of the Exile; for in
"the Book of the Covenant" (Exod. xxiv. 7), which is
the most ancient part of these codes, and comprises
Exod. xx.-xxviii. 33, and is briefly repeated in Exod.
xxxiv. 10-28, there is not only no insistence on a
central shrine, but many of the regulations would have
been rendered impossible had such a shrine existed
(<i>e.g.</i>, Exod. xxi. 6, xxii. 7, 8, where "the judges"
should be "God," as in the R.V.). Indeed, so far from
insistence on one Temple, we expressly read (Exod.
xx. 24), "An altar of earth shalt thou make Me, and
shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings and thy peace
offerings, thy sheep and thine oxen, <i>in all places where
I record My name</i>, and I will come unto thee and bless
thee."</p>

<p>2. Again, the Book of Leviticus lays down a
singularly developed code of ritual, "extending to
the minutest details of worship and of life." Yet there
is scarcely the shadow of a trace of the observance of
even its most reiterated and important provisions during
centuries of Israelitish history. It is emphatically a
priestly book; yet from the days of David down to
those of Josiah, the priests, with few exceptions, are
almost ignored in the national records. They took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
colour of their opinions from the reigning kings, even
in matters which were contrary to the whole extent
and spirit of the Mosaic Code. Samuel, who was not
a priest, nor even a Levite, performed every function
of a priest, and of a high priest, all his life long.</p>

<p>3. Again, as we have seen, in spite of the positive
distinctness of the Second Commandment, not only is
the "calf-worship" established, with scarcely a protest,
throughout the Northern Kingdom; but Solomon even
ventures, without question or reproof, to place twelve
oxen under his brazen sea, and to adorn the steps of
his throne with golden lions.</p>

<p>4. Again, no ceremony was more awful, or more
strikingly symbolical, in the later religion of Israel,
than that of the Great Day of Atonement. It was the
<i>only</i> appointed fast in the Jewish year,<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> a day so sacred
that it acquired the name of <i>Yoma</i>, "the Day." Yet
the Day of Atonement, with its arresting ceremonies
and intense significance, is not so much as once mentioned
outside the Levitical Code by a single prophet,
or priest, or king. It is not even mentioned&mdash;which
is exceedingly strange&mdash;in the post-exilic Books of
Chronicles. Between the Book of Leviticus (with its
supposed date of 1491 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>), down to the days of Philo,
Josephus, and the New Testament, there is not so
much as a hint of the observance of this central
ceremony of the whole Levitic law! What is more
perplexing is, that, in the ideal legislation of Ezekiel,
where alone anything distantly resembling the Day of
Atonement is alluded to (Ezek. xlv. 18-20), the time,
manner, and circumstances are as absolutely different
as if Ezekiel had never read the Levitic law at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
How would any prophet have dared to ignore or alter,
without a word of reference or apology, a rite of Divine
origin and immemorial sanctity, if he had been aware
of its existence?</p>

<p>5. Nor is this only the case with the Day of Atonement.
It seems certain that at Jerusalem there was
not for centuries anything distantly resembling the due
Levitic observance of the three great yearly feasts.
Nehemiah, for instance, tells us in so many words
that since the days of Joshua the son of Nun down
to <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 445&mdash;perhaps for a thousand years&mdash;the Feast
of Tabernacles had never been observed in the most
characteristic of all its appointed rites&mdash;the dwelling
in booths.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>6. Again, although there are slight allusions in some
of the Prophets to "laws" and "statutes" and "commandments,"
their silence about, if not their absolute
ignorance of, anything which resembles the Levitic
legislation as a whole is a startling problem. Thus,
even a late prophet like Jeremiah alludes, without a
word of reprobation, to men cutting and making themselves
bald for the dead (Jer. xvi. 6; comp. xli. 5) in a
way which the Levitic law (Lev. xix. 28; Deut. xiv. 1)
strenuously forbids.</p>

<p>7. Again, as is well known, there is a fundamental
difference between the three codes as to the relative
position of the priests and Levites. (i) In Exod. xix. 6
all Israel is regarded as "a kingdom of priests and
an holy nation," and in Exod. xxiv. 5 the young men
of the children of Israel "offer burnt offerings and
sacrifice peace offerings." (ii) In Numb. iii. 44-51 the
Levites are set aside for the service of the Tabernacle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
in place of the firstborn. But neither in "the Book of
the Covenant" nor in Deuteronomy is there any <i>distinction</i>
between the services of the priests and the
Levites. (iii) In Deut. x. 8 every Levite may become
a priest. All priestly functions are open to the
Levites, and the arrangements for the Levites are
wholly different from those of Numbers. (iv) But in
the Priestly Code only the sons of Aaron are to be
priests (Numb. vi. 22-27, xviii. 1-7; Lev. i. 5, 8). The
Levites are to minister to them in more or less menial
functions, and are permitted a share in the tithes, but
not (as in Deut. xviii. 1) in the firstfruits. We have
first identity of priests and Levites, then partial, then
absolute separation.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> The earliest trace of this degradation
of the Levites is propounded as something
quite new in Ezek. xliv. 10-16, which distinctly implies
(see verse 13) that up to that time the Levites had
enjoyed full priestly rites.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that these facts are not capable
of easy explanation, nor is it strange that they have
led the way to unexpected conclusions. We have to
face the certainty that, for ages together, the Levitic
law was not only a dead letter among the people for
whom it was intended, but that its very existence does
not seem to have been known. "For long periods,"
says Professor Robertson, "the people of Israel seem
to have been as ignorant of their own religion as the
people of Europe were of theirs in the Dark Ages."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
But the problem, were we to pursue it into its details,
is far more perplexing than can be accounted for
by the very partial and misleading parallel which
Professor Robertson adduces. The parallel would be
nearer if, throughout the Dark Ages for a thousand
years together, scarcely a single trace were to be found,
even under the best popes and the most pious kings,
and even in theologic and sacred literature, of so much
as the existence of a New Testament, or of any observance
of the most distinctive festivals and sacraments of
Christianity. And this, as Professor Robertson knows,
is infinitely far from being the case. It is true that an
argument <i>ex silentio</i> may easily be pushed too far; but
we cannot ignore it when it is so striking as this, and
when it is also strengthened by so many positive and
corroborative facts.</p>

<p>A solution of this phenomenon&mdash;which becomes most
salient in the Book of Kings&mdash;is proposed by the
criticism which has received the title of "The Higher
Criticism," because it is historic and constructive, and
rises above purely verbal elements. That solution is
that the Pentateuch is not only a composite structure
(which all would concede), but that it was written in
very different ages, and that much of it is of very late
origin. Critics of the latest school believe that it consists
of three well-marked and entirely different codes
of laws&mdash;namely, "the Book of the Covenant" (Exod.
xx. 23-xxiii.); the "Deuteronomic Code," first brought
into prominence in the reign of Josiah, and written
shortly before that reign; and the "Levitical" or
"Priestly Code," which comprises most of Exodus, and
nearly all Leviticus, and was not introduced till after
the Exile. This would be indeed a radical conclusion,
and cannot yet be regarded as having been conclusively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
established. But so remarkable has been the rapidity
with which the opinion of religious critics has advanced
on the subject, that now even the strongest opponents
of this extreme view admit that <i>the existence of the three
separate codes</i> has been demonstrated, although they
still think that all three may belong to the Mosaic age.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
It is obvious, however, that this view leaves many of the
difficulties entirely untouched. Criticism has not yet
spoken her last word upon the subject, but we ought
to take her views into account in considering the judgments
pronounced by the historian of the Kings. They
were judgments which, in their details, though not as
regards broad moral principles, were based on the
standpoint of a later age. The views of that later age
must be discounted if we have to admit that some of
the ritual innovations and legal transgressions of the
kings were transgressions of laws of the very existence
of which they were profoundly ignorant. That they
<i>were</i> thus ignorant of them is not only implied throughout,
but appears from the direct statements of the
sacred historians.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>The actual Temple building, apart from its spacious
courts, was neither for worshippers nor for priests,
neither for sacrifice nor for prayer. It existed only for
symbolism and, at least in later days, for expiation.
No prayer was offered in the sanctuary. The propitiatory
was the symbol of expiation, but even after
the introduction of the Day of Atonement the atoning
blood was only carried into it once a year.</p>

<p>All the worship was in the outer court, and consisted
mainly, (1) of praise, and (2) of offerings. Both were
prominent in the Dedication Festival.</p>

<p>"It is written," said our Lord, "My house shall
be called a House of Prayer, but ye have made it a den
of robbers." The quotation is from the later Isaiah,
and represents a happy advance in spiritual religion.
Among the details of the Levitic Tabernacle no mention
is made of prayer, though it was symbolised both in
the incense and in the sacrifices which have been called
"unspoken prayers."<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> "<i>Let my prayer be set forth as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
incense</i>," says the Psalmist, "<i>and the lifting up of my
hands as the evening sacrifice</i>." In the New Testament
we read that "the whole multitude of the people were
praying without at the time of incense." But during
the whole history of the first Temple we only hear&mdash;and
that very incidentally&mdash;of <i>private</i> prayer in the
Temple. Solomon's prayer was public, and combined
prayer with praises and benedictions. But no fragments
of Jewish liturgies have come down to us which
we can with any probability refer to the days of the
kings. The Psalms which most clearly belong to the
Temple service are mainly services of praise.</p>

<p>In the mind of the people the <i>sacrifices</i> were
undoubtedly the main part of the Temple ritual. This
fact was specially emphasised by the scene which
marked the Festival of the Dedication.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine a scene which to our unaccustomed
senses would have been more revolting than
the holocausts of a great Jewish Festival like that of
Solomon's Dedication. As a rule the daily sacrifices,
exclusively of such as might be brought by private worshippers,
were the lambs slain at morning and evening.
Yet Maimonides gives us the very material and unpoetic
suggestion that the incense used was to obviate
the effluvium of animal sacrifice. The suggestion is
unworthy of the great Rabbi's ability, and is wholly
incorrect; but it reminds us of the almost terrible fact
that, often and often, the Temple must have been converted
into one huge and abhorrent <i>abattoir</i>, swimming
with the blood of slaughtered victims, and rendered
intolerably repulsive by heaps of bloody skins and
masses of offal. The smell of burning flesh, the swift
putrescence caused by the tropic heat, the unlovely
accompaniments of swarms of flies, and ministers with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
blood-drenched robes would have been inconceivably
disagreeable to our Western training&mdash;for no one will
believe the continuous miracle invented by the Rabbis,
who declare that no fly was ever seen in the Temple,
and no flesh ever grew corrupt.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> No doubt the brazen
sea and the movable caldrons were in incessant requisition,
and there were provisions for vast storages
of water. These could have produced a very small
mitigation of the accompanying pollutions during a
festival which transformed the great court of the Temple
into the reeking shambles and charnel-house of sheep
and oxen "which could not be told nor numbered for
multitude."</p>

<p>Had such spectacles been frequent, we should surely
have had to say of the people of Jerusalem as Sir
Monier Williams says of the ancient Hindus, "The land
was saturated with blood, and people became wearied
and disgusted with slaughtered sacrifices and sacrificing
priests."<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> What infinite, and what revolting labour,
must have been involved in the right burning of "the
two kidneys and the fat," and the due disposition of the
"inwards" of all these holocausts! The groaning brazen
altar, vast as it was, failed to meet the requirements of
the service, and apparently a multitude of other altars
were extemporised for the occasion.</p>

<p>When the festival was over God appeared to Solomon
in vision, as He had done at Gibeon. So far Solomon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
had not gravely or consciously deflected from the ideal
of a theocratic king. Anything which had been worldly
or mistaken in his policy&mdash;the oppression into which
he had been led, the heathen alliances which he had
formed, his crowded harem, his evident fondness for
material splendour which carried with it the peril
of selfish pride&mdash;were only signs of partial knowledge
and human frailty. His heart was still, on the whole,
right with God. He was once more assured in nightly
vision that his prayer and supplication were accepted.
The promise was renewed that if he would walk in
integrity and uprightness his throne should be established
for ever; but that if he or his children swerved
into apostasy Israel should be driven into exile, and,
as a warning to all lands, "this house, which I have
hallowed for My name, will I cast out of My sight,
and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among
all people."</p>

<p>Here, then, we are brought face to face with problems
which arise from the whole system of worship in the
Old Dispensation. Whatever it was, to whatever
extent it was really carried out and was not merely
theoretical, at whatever date its separate elements
originated, and however clear it is that it has utterly
passed away, there must have been certain ideas underlying
it which are worthy of our study.</p>

<p>1. Of the element of praise, supported by music,
we need say but little. It is a natural mode of
expressing the joy and gratitude which fill the heart
of man in contemplating the manifold mercies of God.
For this reason the pages of Scripture ring with
religious music from the earliest to the latest age. We
are told in the Chronicles that triumphant praise was
largely introduced into the great festival services, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
that the Temple possessed a great organisation for vocal
and orchestral music. David was not only a poet,
but an inventor of musical instruments.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> Fifteen
musical instruments are mentioned in the Bible, and
five of them in the Pentateuch. Most important among
them are cymbals, flutes, silver trumpets, rams' horns,
the harp (<i>Kinnor</i>) and the ten-stringed lute (<i>Nevel</i>).<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>
The remark of Josephus that Solomon provided 40,000
harps and lutes and 200,000 silver trumpets is marked
by that disease of exaggeration which seems to infect
the mind of all later Jewish writers when they look
back with yearning to the vanished glories of their
past. There can, however, be no doubt that the
orchestra was amply supplied, and that there was a
very numerous and well-trained choir.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> We read in
the Psalms and elsewhere of tunes which they were
trained to sing. Such tunes were "The Well," and
"The Bow," and "The Gazelle of the morning," and
"All my fresh springs shall be in Thee," and "Die
for the son" (<i>Muth-labben</i>).<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> In the second Temple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
female singers were admitted;<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> in Herod's Temple
Levite choir-boys took their place.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> The singing
was often antiphonal. Some of the music still used
in the synagogue must date from these times, and
there is no reason to doubt that in the so-called
Gregorian <i>tones</i> we have preserved to us a close
approximation to the ancient hymnody of the Temple.
This element of ancient worship calls for no remark.
It is a religious instinct to use music in the service of
God; and perhaps the imagination of St. John in the
Revelation, when he describes the rapture of the
heavenly host pouring forth the chant "Alleluia, for
the Lord God omnipotent reigneth," was coloured by
reminiscences of gorgeous functions in which he had
taken part on the "Mountain of the House."</p>

<p>2. When we proceed to speak of <i>the Priesthood</i> we
are met by difficulties, to which we have already alluded,
as to the date of the varying regulations respecting
it. "It would be difficult," says Dr. Edersheim, "to
conceive arrangements more thoroughly or consistently
opposed to what are commonly called 'priestly pretensions'
than those of the Old Testament."<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> According
to the true ideal, Israel was to be "a kingdom
of priests and an holy nation";<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> but the institution of
<i>ministering</i> priests was of course a necessity, and the
Jewish priesthood, which is now utterly abrogated,
was, or gradually became, representative. Representatively
they had to mediate between God and Israel,
and typically to symbolise the "holiness," <i>i.e.</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
consecration of the Chosen People. Hence they were
required to be free from every bodily blemish. It was
regarded as a deadly offence for any one of them
to officiate without scrupulous safeguard against every
ceremonial defilement, and they were specially adorned
and anointed for their office. They were an extremely
numerous body, and from the days of David are said to
have been divided into twenty-four courses. They were
assisted by an army of attendant Levites, also divided
into twenty-four courses, who acted as the cleansers
and keepers of the Temple. But the distinction of
priests and Levites does not seem to be older than
"the Priestly Code," and criticism has all but demonstrated
that the sections of the Pentateuch known by
that name belong, in their present form, not to the
age of Moses, but to the age of the successors of
Ezekiel. The elaborate priestly and Levitic arrangements
ascribed to the days of Aaron by the chronicler,
who wrote six hundred years after David's day, are
unknown to the writers of the Book of Kings.</p>

<p>In daily life they wore no distinctive dress. In the
Temple service, all the year round, their vestments were
of the simplest. They were of white <i>byssus</i> to typify
innocence,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> and four in number to indicate completeness.
They consisted of a turban, breeches, and
seamless coat of white linen, together with a girdle,
symbolic of zeal and activity, which was assumed during
actual ministrations.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> The only magnificent vestments
were those worn for a few hours by the high priest
once a year on the Great Day of Atonement. These
"golden vestments" were eight in number. To the
ordinary robes were added the robe of the ephod (<i>Meil</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
of dark blue, with seventy-two golden bells, and pomegranates
of blue, purple, and scarlet; a jewelled pectoral
containing the Urim and Thummim; the mitre; and
the golden frontlet (<i>Ziz</i>), with its inscription of "Holiness
to the Lord." The ideal type was fulfilled, and
the poor shadows abolished for ever, by Him of whom
it is said, "Such an high priest became us, who is holy,
harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners."</p>

<p>The priests were poor; they were very often entirely
unlettered; they seem to have had for many centuries
but little influence on the moral and spiritual life of the
people. Hardly any good is recorded of them as a body
throughout the four hundred and ten years during which
the first Temple stood, as very little good had been
recorded of them in the earlier ages, and not much in
the ages which were to follow. We read of scarcely a
single moral protest or spiritual awakenment which had
its origin in the priestly body. Their temptation was to
be absorbed in their elaborate ceremonials. As these
differed but little from the ritual functions of surrounding
heathendom they seem to have relapsed into
apostasy with shameful readiness, and to have submitted
without opposition to the idolatrous aberrations
of king after king, even to the extent of admitting the
most monstrous idols and the most abhorrent pollutions
into the sacred precincts of the Temple, which it was
their work to guard. When a prophet arose out of
their own supine and torpid ranks he invariably counted
his brethren amongst his deadliest antagonists. They
ridiculed him as they ridiculed Isaiah; they smote him
on the cheek as they smote Jeremiah. The only thing
which roused them was the spirit of revolt against their
vapid ceremonialism, and their abject obedience to
kings. The Presbyterate could have no worse ideal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
and could follow no more pernicious example, than that
of the Jewish priesthood. The days of their most rigid
ritualism were the days also of their most desperate
moral blindness. The crimes of their order culminated
when they combined, as one man, under their high
priest Caiaphas and their sagan Annas<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> to reject
Christ for Barabbas, and to hand over to the Gentiles
for crucifixion the Messiah of their nation, the Lord
of Life.</p>

<h3><i>THE TEMPLE SACRIFICES.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">1 Kings</span> viii. 62-66, ix. 25.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have chosen this house to Myself for an house of sacrifice."&mdash;2
Chron. vii. 12.</p>

<p>"Gifts and sacrifices, that cannot, as touching the conscience, make
the worshipper perfect, being only ... carnal ordinances, imposed
until a time of reformation."&mdash;Heb. ix. 9, 10.</p></blockquote>


<p>The whole sacrificial system with which our thoughts
of Judaism are perhaps erroneously, and much
too exclusively identified, furnishes us with many
problems.</p>

<p>Whether it was originally of Divine origin, or whether
it was only an instinctive expression, now of the
gratitude, and now of the guilt and fear, of the human
heart, we are not told. Nor is the basal idea on which
it was founded ever explained to us. Were the ideas of
"atonement" or propitiation (<i>Kippurim</i>) really connected
with those of substitution and vicarious punishment?
Or was the main conception that of <i>self</i>-sacrifice, which
was certainly most prominent in the burnt offerings?
Doubtless the views alike of priests and worshippers
were to a great extent indefinite. We are not told
what led Cain and Abel to present their sacrifices to
God; nor did Moses&mdash;if he were its founder&mdash;furnish
any theories to explain the elaborate system laid down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
in the Book of Leviticus. The large majority of the
Jews probably sacrificed simply because to do so had
become a part of their religious observances, and because
in doing so they believed themselves to be obeying
a Divine command. Others, doubtless, had as many
divergent theories as Christians have when they attempt
to explain the Atonement. The "<i>substitution</i>" theory
of the "sin offering" finds little or no support from the
Old Testament; not only is it never stated, but there
is not a single clear allusion to it. It is emphatically
asserted by later Jewish authorities, such as Rashi,
Aben Ezra, Moses ben-Nachman, and Maimonides, and
is enshrined in the Jewish liturgy. Yet Dr. Edersheim
writes: "The common idea that the burning, either of
part or the whole of the sacrifice, pointed to its destruction,
and symbolised the wrath of God and the punishment
due to sin, does not seem to accord with the
statements of Scripture."<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>Sacrifices were of two kinds, bloody (<i>Zebach</i>; LXX.,
&#952;&#965;&#963;&#8055;&#945;), or unbloody (<i>minchah</i>, <i>korban</i>; LXX., &#948;&#8182;&#961;&#959;&#957;,
&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#8049;). The latter were oblations. Such were the
cakes of shewbread, the meal and drink offerings,
the first sheaf at Passover, the two loaves at Pentecost.
In almost every instance the <i>minchah</i> accompanied the
offering of a sacrificial victim.</p>

<p>The two general rules about all victims for sacrifice
were, (1) that they should be without blemish and
without spot, as types of perfectness; and (2) that
every sacrifice should be salted with salt, as an antiseptic,
and therefore a type of incorruption.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>Sacrificial victims could only be chosen from oxen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
sheep, goats, turtle doves, and young pigeons&mdash;the
latter being the offering of the poor who could not
afford the costlier victims.</p>

<p>Sacrifices were also divided generally (1) into free,
or obligatory; (2) public, or private; and (3) most
holy or less holy, of which the latter were slain at the
north and the former at the east side of the altar.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>
The offerer, according to the Rabbis, had to do five
things&mdash;to lay on hands, slay, skin, dissect, and wash
the inwards. The priest had also to do five things
at the altar itself&mdash;to catch the blood, sprinkle it,
light the fire, bring up the pieces, and complete the
sacrifices.</p>

<p>Sacrifices are chiefly dwelt upon in the Priestly
Code; but nowhere in the Old Testament is their
significance formally explained, nor for many centuries
was the Levitic ritual much regarded.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>The sacrifices commanded in the Pentateuch fall
under four heads. (1) The burnt offering (<i>Olah</i>, <i>Kalil</i>),<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
which typified complete self-dedication, and which even
the heathen might offer; (2) the sin offering (<i>Chattath</i>),<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
which made atonement for the offender; (3) the trespass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
offering (<i>Ashâm</i>),<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> which atones for some special
offence, whether doubtful or certain, committed through
ignorance; and (4) the thank offering, eucharistic peace
offering (<i>Shelem</i>),<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> or "offering of completion," which
followed the other sacrifices, and of which the flesh was
eaten by the priest and the worshippers.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>The oldest practice seems only to have known of
burnt offerings and thank offerings, and the former
seem only to have been offered at great sacrificial
feasts. Even in Deuteronomy a common phrase for
sacrifices is "eating before the Lord," which is almost
ignored in the Priestly Code. Of the sin offering,
which in that code has acquired such enormous importance,
there is scarcely a trace&mdash;unless Hosea iv. 8
be one, which is doubtful&mdash;before Ezekiel, in whom the
<i>Ashâm</i> and <i>Chattath</i> occur in place of the old pecuniary
fines (2 Kings xii. 16). Originally sacrifice was a glad
meal, and even in the oldest part of the code (Lev.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
xvii.-xxvi.) sacrifices are comprised under the <i>Olam</i>
and <i>Zebach</i>. The turning-point of the history of the
sacrificial system is Josiah's reformation, of which the
Priestly Code is the matured result.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>It is easy to see that sacrifices in general were
eucharistic, dedicatory, and expiatory.</p>

<p>The eucharistic sacrifices (the meal and peace offerings)
and the burnt offerings, which indicated the
entire sacrifice of self, were the offerings of those who
were in communion with God. They were recognitions
of His absolute supremacy. The sin and trespass offerings
were intended to recover a lost communion with
God. And thus the sacrifices were, or ultimately came
to be, the expression of the great ideas of thanksgiving,
of self-dedication, and of propitiation. But the Israelites,
"while they seem always to have retained the idea of
propitiation and of eucharistic offering, constantly
ignored the self-dedication, which is the link between
the two, and which the regular burnt offering should
have impressed upon them as their daily thought and
duty." Had they kept this in view they would have
been saved from the superstitions and degeneracies
which made their use of the sacrificial system a curse
and not a blessing. The expiatory conception, which
was probably the latest of the three, expelled the
others, and was perverted into the notion that God was
a God of wrath, whose fury could be averted by gifts
and His favour won by bribes. There was this truth
in the notion of propitiation&mdash;that God hates, and is
alienated by, and will punish, sin; and yet that in His
mercy He has provided an Atonement for us. But in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
trying to imagine <i>how the sacrifice affected God</i>, the
Israelites lost sight of the truth that <i>this</i> is an inexplicable
mystery, and that all which we can know is the
effect which <i>it can produce on the souls of man</i>. If they
had interpreted the sacrifices as a whole to mean this
only&mdash;that man is guilty and that God is merciful; and
that though man's guilt separates him from God,
reunion with Him can be gained by confession, penitence,
and self-sacrifice, by virtue of an Atonement
which He had revealed and would accept&mdash;then the
effect of them would have been spiritually wholesome
and ennobling. But when they came to think that
sacrifices were presents to God, which might be put in
the place of amendment and moral obedience, and that
the punishment due to their offences might be thus
mechanically diverted upon the heads of innocent
victims, then the sacrificial system was rendered not
only nugatory but pernicious. Nor have Christians
been exempt from a similar corruption of the doctrine
of the Atonement. In treating it as vicarious and
expiatory they have forgotten that it is unavailing
unless it be also representative. In looking upon it as
the atonement <i>for</i> sin they have overlooked that there
can be no such atonement unless it be accompanied by
redemption <i>from</i> sin. They have tacitly and practically
acted on the notion, which in the days of St. Paul some
even avowed, that "we may continue in sin that grace
may abound." But in the great work of redemption
the will of man cannot be otiose. He must himself
die with Christ. As Christ was sacrificed for him
he, too, must offer his body a living sacrifice, holy,
acceptable unto God. "Without the sin offering of
the Cross," says Bishop Barry, "our burnt offering (of
self-dedication) would be impossible; so also without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the burnt offering the sin offering will, to us, be
unavailing."<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>Many of the crudities, and even horrors, which, alike
in Jewish and Christian times, have been mixed up
with the idea of bloody sacrifices, would have been
removed if more attention had been paid to the prominence
and real significance of <i>blood</i> in the entire
ritual. As taught by some revivalists the doctrine of
the blood adds the most revolting touches to theories
which assimulate God to Moloch; but the true significance
of the phrase and of the symbol elevates the
entire doctrine of sacrifice into a purer and more
spiritual atmosphere.</p>

<p>The central significance of the whole doctrine lies
in the ancient opinion that "the blood" of the sacrifice
was "its life." This was why an expiatory power was
ascribed to the blood. There was certainly no transfer
of guilt to the animal, <i>for its blood remained clean and
cleansing</i>. Nor was the animal supposed to undergo
the transgressor's punishment; first, because this is
nowhere stated, and next, because had that been the
case, fine flour would certainly not have been permitted
(as it was) as a sin offering.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Moreover, no
wilful offence, no offence "with uplifted hand," <i>i.e.</i>,
with evil premeditation, <i>could</i> be atoned for either by
sin or trespass offerings;&mdash;though certainly so wide
a latitude was given to the notion of sin as an
<i>involuntary</i> error as to tend to break down the notion
of moral responsibility. The sin offering was further
offered for some purely accidental and ceremonial
offences, which could not involve any real consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
of guilt.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> "The blood of the covenant" (Exod.
xxiv. 4-8) was not of the <i>sin</i> offering, but of peace and
burnt offerings; and though, as Canon Cook says, we
read of blood in paganism as a propitiation to a hostile
demon, "we seem to seek in vain for an instance
in which the blood, as a natural symbol for the soul,
was offered as an atoning sacrifice."<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> "The atoning
virtue of the blood lies not in its material substance,
but in the life of which it is the vehicle," says Bishop
Westcott. "The blood always includes the thought
of the life preserved and active beyond death. It is
not simply the price by which the redeemed were purchased,
but the power by which they were quickened
so as to be capable of belonging to God." "To drink
the blood of Christ," says Clement of Alexandria, "is
to partake of the Lord's incorruption."<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>Besides the points to which we have alluded, there
is a further difficulty created by the singular silence
<i>respecting sin offerings of any kind</i>, except in that part
of the Old Testament which has recently acquired the
name of the Priestly Code.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>The word <i>Chattath</i>, in the sense of sin offering,
occurs in Exod. xxix., xxx., and many times in Leviticus
and Numbers, and six times in Ezekiel. Otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
in the Old Testament it is barely mentioned, except in
the post-exilic Books of Chronicles (2 Chron. xxix. 24)
and Ezra (viii. 25).<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> It is not mentioned in any other
historic book; nor in any prophet except Ezekiel.
Again, as we have seen, the Day of Atonement leaves
not a trace in any of the earlier historic records of
Scripture, and is found only in the authorities above
mentioned. Through all the rest of Scripture the scape-goat
is unmentioned, and Azazel is ignored. Dr. Kalisch
goes so far as to say that "there is conclusive evidence
to prove that the Day of Atonement was instituted
considerably more than a thousand years after the
death of Moses and Aaron.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> For even in Ezekiel, who
wrote <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 574, there is no Day of Atonement on the
tenth day of the seventh month, but on the first and
seventh of the first month (Abib, Nisan)." He thinks
it utterly impossible that, had it existed in his time,
Ezekiel could have blotted out the holiest day of the
year, and substituted two of his own arbitrary choice.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
The rites, moreover, which he describes differ wholly
from those laid down in Leviticus. Even in Nehemiah
there is no notice of the Day of Atonement, though a
day was observed on the twenty-fourth of the month.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Hence this learned writer infers that even in B.C. 440
the Great Day of Atonement was not yet recognised,
and that the pagan element of sending the scape-goat
to Azazel, the demon of the wilderness, proves the late
date of the ceremony.</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe how utterly the sacrificial
priestly system, in the abuses which not only became
involved in it, but seemed to be almost inseparable
from it, is condemned by the loftier spiritual intuition
which belongs to phases of revelation higher than the
external and the typical.</p>

<p>Thus in the Old Testament no series of inspired
utterances is more interesting, more eloquent, more
impassioned and ennobling, than those which insist
upon the utter nullity of all sacrifices in themselves,
and their absolute insignificance in comparison with
the lightest element of the moral law. On this subject
the Prophets and the Psalmists use language so
sweeping and exceptionless as almost to repudiate the
desirability of sacrifices altogether. They speak of them
with a depreciation akin to scorn. It may be doubted
whether they had the Mosaic system with all its details,
as we know it, before them. They do not enter into
those final elaborations which it assumed, and not one
of them so much as alludes to any service which
resembles the powerfully symbolic ceremonial of the
Great Day of Atonement. But they speak of the
ceremonial law in such fragments and aspects of it
as were known to them. They deal with it as priests
practised it, and as priests taught&mdash;if they ever taught
anything&mdash;respecting it. They speak of it as it presented
itself to the minds of the people around them,
with whom it had become rather a substitute for moral
efforts and an obstacle in the path of righteousness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
than an aid to true religion. And this is what they
say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hath the Lord as great delight in sacrifice," asks
the indignant <span class="smcap">Samuel</span>, "as in obeying the voice of the
Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to
hearken than the fat of rams."<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>"I hate, I despise your feasts," says Jehovah by
Amos, "and I will take no delight in your solemn
assemblies. Yea, though ye offer Me your burnt offerings
and meal offerings, I will not accept them: neither
will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.
Turn thou away from Me the noise of thy songs; for I
will not hear the melody of thy viols. But let judgment
roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty
stream."<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>"Wherewith shall I come before the Lord," asks
<span class="smcap">Micah</span>, "and bow myself before the most high God?
Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with
calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with
thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of
oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression,
the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He hath
showed thee, O man, what is good: and what doth
the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love
mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> again in a message of Jehovah, twice quoted
on different occasions by our Lord, says: "I desire
mercy and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God
more than burnt offerings."<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> also, in the word of the Lord, gives burning
expression to the same conviction: "To what purpose
is the multitude of your sacrifices unto Me?
saith the Lord: I am full of the burnt offerings
of lambs, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight
not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.
When ye come to appear before Me, who hath
required this at your hands, to trample My courts?
Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination
unto Me; new moon and sabbath, the calling of
assemblies,&mdash;I cannot away with iniquity and the solemn
meeting. Your new moons and your appointed feasts
My soul hateth: they are a cumbrance unto Me; I am
weary to bear them.... Wash you, make you clean!"<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>The language of <span class="smcap">Jeremiah's</span> message is even more
startling: "<i>I spake not unto your fathers</i>, nor commanded
them in the day that I brought them out of the
land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:
but this thing I commanded them, saying, Obey My
voice." And again&mdash;in the version of the LXX.,
given in the margin of the Revised Version for the
unintelligible rendering of the Authorised Version&mdash;he
asks: "Why hath the beloved wrought abomination in
My house? Shall vows and holy flesh take away from
thee thy wickedness, or shalt thou escape by these?"<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>Jeremiah is, in fact, the most anti-ritualistic of the
prophets. So far from having hid and saved the Ark,
he regarded it as entirely obsolete (iii. 16). He cares
only for the spiritual covenant written on the heart,
and very little, if at all, for Temple services and Levitic
scrupulosities (vii. 4-15, xxxi. 31-34).<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>Surely the most careless and conventional reader
cannot fail to see that there is a wide difference between
the standpoint of the prophets, which is so purely
spiritual, and that of the writers and redactors of the
Priestly Code, whose whole interest centred in the
sacrificial and ceremonial observances.</p>

<p>Nor is the intrinsic nullity of the sacrificial system
less distinctly pointed out in the New Testament.
The better-instructed Jews, enlightened by Christ's
teaching, could give emphatic testimony to the immeasurable
superiority of the moral to the ceremonial.
The candid scribe, hearing from Christ's lips the two
great commandments, answers, "Of a truth, Master,
Thou hast well said that He is one; and there is none
other but He: and to love Him with all the heart, ...
and to love his neighbour as himself, is much more than
all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>And our Lord quoted Hosea with the emphatic
commendation, "Go ye and learn what that meaneth,
I desire mercy, and not sacrifice."<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> And on another
occasion: "But if ye had known what this meaneth,
I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have
condemned the guiltless."<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>The presenting of our bodies, says St. Paul, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
a living sacrifice is our reasonable service; and St.
Peter calls all Christians a holy priesthood to offer
up spiritual sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>"It is impossible," says the writer of the Epistle
to the Hebrews, "that the blood of bulls and goats
should take away sins;" and he speaks of the priests
"daily offering the same sacrifice, the which can never
take away sins."<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To do good and to distribute forget not: for with
<i>such</i> sacrifices God is well pleased."<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>The wisest fathers of Jewish thought in the post-exilic
epoch held the same views. Thus the son of
Sirach says: "He that keepeth the law bringeth
offerings enough."<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> And Philo, echoing an opinion
common among the best heathen moralists from Socrates
to Marcus Aurelius,<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> writes, "The mind, when without
blemish, is itself the most holy sacrifice, being entirely
and in all respects pleasing to God."<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>And what is very remarkable, modern Judaism now
emphasises its belief that "neither sacrifices nor a
Levitical system belong to the essence of the Old
Testament."<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> Such was the view of the ancient
Essenes, no less than of Maimonides or Abarbanel.
Modern Rabbis even go so far as to argue that the
whole system of Levitical sacrifice was an alien element,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
introduced into Judaism from without, tolerated indeed
by Moses, but only as a concession to the immaturity
of his people and their hardness of heart.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>Such, too, was the opinion of the ancient Fathers,&mdash;of
the author of the Epistle of Barnabas, of Justin
Martyr, Origen, Tertullian, Jerome, Chrysostom, Epiphanius,
Cyril, and Theodoret, who are followed by
such Roman Catholic theologians as Petavius and
Bellarmine.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>This at any rate is certain:&mdash;that the Judaic system
is not only abrogated, but rendered impossible. Whatever
were its functions, God has stamped with absolute
disapproval any attempt to continue them. They are
utterly annulled and obliterated for ever.</p>

<p>"I am come to repeal the sacrifices." Such is the
&#7940;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#8057;&#947;&#956;&#945; ascribed to Christ; "and unless ye
desist from sacrificing, the wrath of God will not desist
from you."<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> The argument of St. Paul in the Epistles
to the Romans and Galatians, and of the writer of the
Epistle to the Hebrews, show us why this was inevitable;
and they were but following the initiative
of Christ and the teaching of His Spirit. It is a
mistake to imagine that our Lord merely repudiated
the inane pettinesses of Pharisaic formalism. He went
much further. There is not the slightest trace that
He personally observed the requirements of the ceremonial
law. It is certain that He broke them when
He touched the leper and the dead youth's bier. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
law insisted on the centralisation of worship, but Jesus
said, "The day cometh, and now is, when neither
in Jerusalem, nor yet in this mountain, shall men
worship the Father. God is a Spirit, and they that
worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth."
The law insisted, with extreme emphasis, on the
burdensome distinctions between clean and unclean
meats. Jesus said that it is not that which cometh
from without, but that which cometh from within which
defileth a man, and this He said "<i>making all meats
clean</i>."<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> St. Paul, when the types of Mosaism had
been for ever fulfilled in Christ, and the antitype had
thus become obsolete and pernicious, went further
still. Taking circumcision, the most ancient and most
distinctive rite of the Old Dispensation, he called it
"concision" or mere mutilation, and said thrice over,
"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing,
but 'a new creature'"; "but faith working by love,"
"but the keeping of the commandment of God." The
whole system of Judaism was local, was external, was
minute, was inferior, was transient, was a concession
to infirmity, was a yoke of bondage: the whole system
of Christianity is universal, is spiritual, is simple,
is unsacrificial, is unsacerdotal, is perfect freedom.
Judaism was a religion of a temple, of sacrifices, of
a sacrificial priesthood: Christianity is a religion in
which the Spirit of God</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i27">"Doth prefer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before all temples the upright heart and pure."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is a religion in which there is no more sacrifice
for sin, because the one perfect and sufficient sacrifice,
oblation and satisfaction, has been consummated for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
ever. It is a religion in which there is no altar but the
Cross; in which there is no priest but Christ, except
so far as <i>every</i> Christian is by metaphor a priest to
offer up spiritual sacrifices which alone are acceptable
to God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Temple of Solomon lasted only four centuries,
and they were for the most part years of dishonour,
disgrace, and decadence.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Solomon was scarcely in his
grave before it was plundered by Shishak. During its
four centuries of existence it was again stripped of its
precious possessions at least six times, sometimes by
foreign oppressors, sometimes by distressed kings. It
was despoiled of its treasure by Asa, by Jehoash of
Judah, by Jehoash of Israel, by Ahaz, by Hezekiah,
and lastly by Nebuchadnezzar. After such plunderings
it must have completely lost its pristine splendour.
But the plunder of its treasures was nothing to the
pollutions of its sanctity. They began as early as the
reigns of Rehoboam and Abijah. Ahaz gave it a Syrian
altar, Manasseh stained it with impurities, and Ezekiel
in its secret chambers surveyed "the dark idolatries of
alienated Judah."</p>

<p>And in the days when Judaism most prized itself on
ritual faithfulness, the Lord of the Temple was insulted
in the Temple of the Lord, and its courts were turned
by greedy priests and Sadducees into a cowshed, and a
dovecot, and a fair, and a usurer's mart, and a robber's
den.</p>

<p>From the first the centralisation of worship in the
Temple must have been accompanied by the danger of
dissociating religious life from its daily social environments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
The multitudes who lived in remote country
places would no longer be able to join in forms of
worship which had been carried on at local shrines.
Judaism, as the prophets so often complain, tended to
become too much a matter of officialism and function,
of rubric and technique, which always tend to substitute
external service for true devotion, and to leave the shell
of religion without its soul.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>Even when it had been purified by Josiah's reformation,
the Temple proved to be a source of danger and
false security. It was regarded as a sort of Palladium.
The formalists began to talk and act as though it
furnished a mechanical protection, and gave them
licence to transgress the moral law. Jeremiah had
sternly to warn his countrymen against this trust in
an idle formalism. "Amend your ways and your
doings," he said. "Behold, ye trust in lying words
which cannot profit. Will ye steal, murder, and commit
adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal,
and walk after other gods whom ye have not known,
and come and stand before Me in this house, which is
called by My name, and say, We are delivered; that
ye may do all these abominations?"</p>

<p>The Temple of Solomon was defaced and destroyed
and polluted by the Babylonians, but not until it had
been polluted by the Jews themselves with the blood
of prophets, by idolatries, by chambers of unclean
imagery. It was rebuilt by a poor band of disheartened
exiles to be again polluted by Antiochus
Epiphanes, and ultimately to become the headquarters
of a narrow, arrogant, and intriguing Pharisaism. It
was rebuilt once more by Herod, the brutal Idumean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
usurper, and its splendour inspired such passionate
enthusiasm that when it was wrapped in flames by
Titus, it witnessed the carnage of thousands of maddened
and despairing combatants.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As 'mid the cedar courts and gates of gold<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The trampled ranks in miry carnage rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To save their Temple every hand essayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And with cold fingers grasp'd the feeble blade;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Through their torn veins reviving fury ran<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And life's last anger warm'd the dying man."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yet that last Temple had been defiled by a worse
crime than the other two. It had witnessed the priestly
idols and the priestly machinations which ended in the
murder of the Son of God. From the Temple sprang
little or nothing of spiritual importance. Intended to
teach the supremacy of righteousness, it became the
stronghold of mere ritual. For the development of true
holiness, as apart from ceremonial scrupulosity, its
official protectors rendered it valueless.</p>

<p>We are not surprised that Christianity knows no
temple but the hearts of all who love the Lord Jesus
Christ in sincerity and truth; and that the characteristic
of the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven

<p>The history of the Temple is the event which
gives supreme religious importance to the reign
of one who became in other respects a worldly and
irreligious king. It is for this reason that I have dwelt
upon its significance, and on the many interesting questions
which its worship naturally suggests. Solomon
gave an impulse to outward service, not to spiritual
life. His religion was mainly that form of externalism
which rose but little above the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Gay religions full of pomp and gold"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>of the surrounding heathens. The other fragments of
his story which have been preserved for us are mainly
of a political character. They point us to Solomon in
his wealth and ostentation, and contain nothing specially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
edifying. Our Lord thought less of all this splendour
than of the flower of the field. "Consider the lilies
of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do
they spin: yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his
glory was not arrayed like one of these."</p>

<p>Princes who have once begun to build find a certain
fascination in the task. After the seven years devoted
to the Temple, Solomon occupied thirteen more in
building "halls of Lebanoniac cedar" for himself, for
his audience-chamber, and for Pharaoh's daughter.</p>

<p>Chief of these were:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The house of the forest of Lebanon, a sort of
arsenal so called from its triple rows of cedar pillars,
on which hung the golden shields for the king's guards
when they attended his great visits to the Temple.</p>

<p>2. The justice hall, the "Sublime Porte" of Jerusalem,
built of gold and cedar. It contained the famous
Lion Throne of gold and ivory, with two lions on each
of its six steps.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> It is not known whether these buildings
formed part of the palace and harem of Solomon,
nor is it worth while to waste time on the impossible
attempt to reconstruct them.</p>

<p>Solomon also built the fortification of Jerusalem
known as the "Millo," and the wall of Jerusalem, and
repaired the breaches of the city of David,<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> as well as
the fortresses and treasure cities to which we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
already alluded, and the summer palaces in the region
of Lebanon known as "the delights of Solomon."<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>
Amid these records of palatial architecture we hear
next to nothing of the religious life.</p>

<p>He further dazzled his people by an extensive system
of foreign commerce. His land-traffic with Arabia
familiarised them with spicery (<i>necoth</i>), gum tragacanth,
frankincense, myrrh, aloes, and cassia and with precious
stones of all kinds. From Egypt he obtained
horses and chariots. They were brought from Tekoa,
by his merchants, and kept by Solomon, or sold at a
profit.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>He found a ready market for them among the Hittite
and Aramæan kings. Emulating the Ph&#339;nicians, and
apparently invading the monopoly of Tyre, he had&mdash;if
we may take the chronicler literally&mdash;a fleet of "ships
of Tarshish" which sailed along the coasts of Spain.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>
Above all, he made the daring attempt to establish
a fleet of Tarshish-ships at Ezion-Geber, the port of
Elath, at the north of the Gulf of Akaba. This fleet
sailed down the Red Sea to Ophir&mdash;perhaps Abhîra,
at the mouth of the Indus&mdash;and amazed the simple
Hebrews with the sight of gorgeous iridescent peacocks,
wrinkled chattering apes, the red and richly scented
sandal wood of India, and the large tusks of elephants
from which cunning artificers carved the smooth ivory
to inlay furniture, thrones, and ultimately even houses,
with lustrous ornamentation. Cinnamon came to him
from Ceylon, and "sapphires" (<i>lapis lazuli</i>) from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> Other services which he rendered to his
capital and kingdom were more real and permanent.</p>

<p>1. Jerusalem may have been in part indebted to
Solomon for its supply of water. The magnificent
springs of pure gushing water at Etam are still called
"Solomon's fountains," and it is believed that he used
their rocky basins as reservoirs from which to irrigate
his garden in the Wady Urtas (Lat., <i>Hortus</i>). Etam
is two hours distant from Jerusalem, and if Solomon
built the aqueduct which once conveyed its water
supply to the city he proved himself a genuine benefactor.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
There was immense need of the "fons perennis
aquæ" of which Tacitus speaks for the purifications
of the Temple, soiled by the reek and offal of so many
holocausts.</p>

<p>2. Maritime allusions now began to appear in Hebrew
literature;<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> and maritime enterprise produced the marvellous
effect it always produces on the character and
progress of the nation. Along the black basalt roads&mdash;the
king's highways&mdash;of which the construction was
necessitated by the outburst of commercial activity
flocked hundreds of foreign visitors, not only merchantmen
and itinerant traffickers, but governors of provinces,
and vassal or allied princes. The isolated and stationary
tribes of Palestine suddenly found themselves face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
to face with a new and splendid civilisation. Admiring
visitors flocked to see the great king's magnificence
and to admire his foreign curiosities, bringing with
them presents of gold and silver, armour<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> and spicery,
horses and mules, the broidered garments of Babylon,
and robes rich with the crimson, purple, and scarlet
dyes of Tyre.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> Instead of riding like his predecessors
on a humble mule, the king made his royal progress
to his watered garden at Etam drawn by steeds magnificently
caparisoned. He reclined in "Pharaoh's
chariot" richly chased and brilliantly coloured. He
was followed by a train of archers riding on war-horses
and clothed in purple, and was escorted by a body-guard
of youths tall and beautiful, whose dark and
flowing locks glittered with gold dust. In the heat
of summer, if we may accept the poetic picture of the
Song of Songs, he would be luxuriously carried to
some delicious retreat amid the hills of myrrh and
leopard-haunted woods of Lebanon, in a palanquin
of cedar wood with silver pillars, purple cushions, and
richly embroidered curtains, wearing the jewelled crown
which his mother placed on his head on the day of
his espousals.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> Or he would sit to do justice on his
throne of ivory and gold,<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> with its steps guarded by
golded lions leaning upon the golden bull of Ephraim
which formed its back,<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> in all his princely beauty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
"anointed with the oil of gladness," his lips full of grace,
his garments breathing of perfume. On great occasions
of state his Queen, and the virgins that bore her
company, would stand among the crowd of inferior
princesses, in garments of the wrought gold of Ophir,
in which she had been carried from the inner palace
upon tapestries of needlework. In the pomp of such
ceremonials, amid bursts of rejoicing melody, the people
began to believe that not even the Pharaohs of Egypt,
or the Tyrian kings with "every precious stone as
their covering," could show a more glorious pageant
of royal state.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>This career of magnificence culminated in the visit
of Balkis, the Queen of Sheba,<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> who came to him across
the desert with "a very great train of her camels,
bearing spices and very much gold and precious stones."
She saw his abounding prosperity, his peaceful people,
his houses, his vineyards at Beth-Haccerem, his parks
and gardens, his pools and fruit trees, his herds of
cattle, his horses, chariots, and palanquins, and all the
delight of the sons of men. She saw his men singers
and women singers with their harps of red sandal wood
and gold. She saw him at the banquet at his golden
table covered in boundless profusion with delicacies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
brought from every land. She saw his hosts of beautiful
and richly dressed slaves with lavers, dishes, and
goblets all made of the gold of Uphaz. She saw him
dispensing justice in his pillared hall of cedar, seated
on his lion-throne. She saw the golden shields and
targets<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> carried before him as he went in state to
the Temple over the Mount, across the valley, and
mounted from the palace to the sacred courts by the
gilded staircase with its balustrades of aromatic sandal
wood.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> Perhaps she was present as a spectator at
some great Temple festival. And when she had tested
his wisdom by communing with him of all that was
in her heart, "there was no more spirit in her." She
confessed that the half of his wisdom and glory had
not been reported to her. Happy were his servants,
happy the courtiers who stood by him and heard his
words! Blessed was the Lord his God who delighted
in him, and who, out of love for Israel, had given them
such a king to do justice and judgment among them.
The visit ended with an interchange of royal presents.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
Solomon, we are vaguely told, "gave unto her all
her desire, whatsoever she asked," and sent her away
glad-hearted to her native land, leaving behind her a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
trail of legends. Before her departure she opened her
treasures, and gave him vast stores of spicery and gold.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>And to sum up the accounts, which read like a page
of the story of Haroun al Raschid, the king made
silver to be as stones in Jerusalem, so that it was
nothing accounted of in the day of Solomon,<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> and the
cedars made he to be as the sycomores which are in
the "Shefelah" for multitude.</p>

<p>It is around this epoch of Solomon's career that the
legends of the East mainly cluster. They have received
a larger development from the allusions to Mohammed
in the Qur'an.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> They take the place of the personal
incidents of which so few are recorded, although
Solomon occupies so large a space in sacred history.
"That stately and melancholy figure&mdash;in some respects
the grandest and the saddest in the Sacred Volume&mdash;is
in detail little more than a mighty 'shadow.' Yet
in later Jewish records he is scarcely mentioned. Of
all the characters in the sacred history he is the most
purely secular; and merely secular magnificence was an
excrescence, not a native growth of the chosen people."<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>There was a <i>ver rongeur</i> at the root of all
Solomon's prosperity. His home was afflicted
with the curse of his polygamy, his kingdom with the
curse of his despotism. Failure is stamped upon the
issues of his life.</p>

<p>1. His Temple was a wonder of the world; yet his
own reign was scarcely over before it was plundered
by the Egyptian king who had overthrown the feeble
dynasty on alliance with which he had trusted. Under
later kings its secret chambers were sometimes
desecrated, sometimes deserted. It failed to exercise
the unique influence in support of the worship of
Jehovah for which it had been designed. Some of
Solomon's successors confronted it with a rival temple,
and a rival high priest, of Baal, and suffered atrocious
emblems of heathen nature-worship to profane its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
courts. He himself became an apostate from the high
theocratic ideal which had inspired its origin.</p>

<p>2. His long alliance and friendship with Hiram
ended, to all appearance, in coolness and disgust, even
if it be true that a daughter of Hiram was one of the
princesses of his harem.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> For his immense buildings
had so greatly embarrassed his resources that, when
the day for payment came, the only way in which he
could discharge his obligations was by alienating a part
of his dominions. He gave Hiram "twenty cities in
the land of Galilee." The kings of Judah, down to the
days of Hezekiah, and even of Josiah, show few traces
of any consciousness that there was such a book as
the Pentateuch and such a code as the Levitic law.
Solomon may have been unaware that Ph&#339;nicia itself
was part of the land which God had promised to
His people. If that gift had lapsed through their
inertness,<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> the law still remained, which said, "The
land shall not be sold for ever; for the land is Mine,
for ye are strangers and sojourners with Me." It was a
strong measure to resign any part of the soil of Judæa,
even to discharge building debts, much more to pay for
mercenaries and courtly ostentation. The transaction,
dubious in every particular, was the evident cause of
deep-seated dissatisfaction. Hiram thought himself ill-paid
and unworthily treated. He found, by a personal
visit, that these inland Galilæan towns, which were
probably inhabited in great measure by a wretched and
dwindling remnant of Canaanites,<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> were useless to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
whereas he had probably hoped to receive part, at
least, of the Bay of Acco (Ptolemais).<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> They added so
little to his resources, that he complained to Solomon.
He called the cities by the obscure, but evidently
contemptuous name "<i>Cabul</i>," and gave them back to
Solomon in disgust as not worth having.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> What significance
lies in the strange and laconic addition, "And
Hiram sent to the king six-score talents of gold," it is
impossible for us to understand. If the Tyrian king
gave as a present to Solomon a sum which was so vast
as at least to equal £720,000&mdash;"apparently," as Canon
Rawlinson thinks, "to show that, although disappointed,
he was not offended!"&mdash;he must have been
an angel in human form.</p>

<p>3. Solomon's palatial buildings, while they flattered
his pride and ministered to his luxury, tended directly,
as we shall see, to undermine his power. They
represented the ill-requited toil of hopeless bondmen,
and oppressed freedmen, whose sighs rose, not in vain,
into the ears of the Lord God of Sabaoth.</p>

<p>4. His commerce, showy as it was, turned out to be
transitory and useless. If for a time it enriched the
king, it did not enrich his people. At Solomon's death, if
not earlier, it not only languished but expired. Horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
and chariots might give a pompous aspect to stately
pageants, but they were practically useless in the
endless hills of which Palestine is mainly composed.
Apes, peacocks, and sandal wood were curious and interesting,
but they certainly did not repay the expense
incurred in their importation. No subsequent sovereign
took the trouble to acquire these wonders, nor are they
once mentioned in the later Scriptures. Precious stones
might gleam on the necks of the concubine, or adorn
the housings of the steed, but nothing was gained
from their barren splendour. At one time the king's
annual revenue is stated to have been six hundred and
sixty-six talents of gold; but the story of Hiram, and
the impoverishment to which Rehoboam succeeded,
show that even this exchequer had been exhausted by
the sumptuous prodigalities of a too luxurious court.
And, indeed, the commerce of Solomon gave a new and
untheocratic bias to Hebrew development. The ideal
of the old Semitic life was the pastoral and agricultural
ideal. No other is contemplated in Exod. xxi.-xxix.
Commerce was left to the Ph&#339;nicians and other races,
so that the word for "merchant" was "Canaanite."
But after the days of Solomon in Judah, and Ahab in
Israel, the Hebrews followed eagerly in the steps of
Canaan, and trade and commerce acting on minds
materialised into worldliness brought their natural
consequences. "He is a merchant," says Hosea
(xii. 7); "the balances of deceit are in his hand: he
loveth to defraud." Here the words "he is a merchant"
may equally well be rendered "as for Canaan";
and by Canaan is here meant Canaanised or commercial
Ephraim. And the prophet continues, "And Ephraim
said, Surely I am become rich, I have found me
wealth: in all my labour they shall find in me none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
iniquity that were sin." In other words, these influences
of foreign trade had destroyed the moral
sense of Israel altogether: "Howl, ye inhabitants of
Maktesh"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, "The Mortar," a bazaar of that
name in Jerusalem&mdash;"for all the people of Canaan"
(<i>i.e.</i>, the merchants) "are brought to silence." But the
hypnotising influence of wealth became more and more
a potent factor in the development of the people. By an
absolute reversal of their ancient characteristics they
learnt, in the days of the Rabbis, utterly to despise
agriculture and extravagantly to laud the gains of
commerce. Of too many of them it became true, that
they</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With dumb despair their country's wrongs behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And dead to glory, only burn for gold."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was the mighty hand of Solomon which first gave
them an impulse in this direction, though he seems to
have managed all his commerce with exclusive reference
to his own revenues.</p>

<p>In the wake of commerce, and the inevitable intercourse
with foreign nations which it involves, came as
a matter of course the fondness for luxuries; the taste
for magnificence; the fraternisation with neighbouring
kings; the use of cavalry; the development of a military
caste; the attempts at distant navigation; the total
disappearance of the antique simplicity. In the train
of these innovations followed the disastrous alterations
of the old conditions of society of which the prophets
so grievously complain&mdash;extortions of the corn market;
the formation of large estates; the frequency of mortgages;
the misery of peasant proprietorship, unable to
hold its own against the accumulations of wealth; the
increase of the wage-receiving class; and the fluctuations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
of the labour market. These changes caused, by way
of consequence, so much distress and starvation that
even freeborn Hebrews were sometimes compelled to
sell themselves into slavery as the only way to keep
themselves alive.</p>

<p>So that the age of Solomon can in no respect be
regarded as an age of gold. Rather, it resembled that
grim Colossus of Dante's vision, which not only rested
on a right foot of brittle clay, but was cracked and
fissured through and through, while the wretchedness
and torment which lay behind the outward splendour
ever dripped and trickled downward till its bitter streams
swelled the rivers of hell:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Abhorrèd Styx, the flood of deadly hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sad Acheron of sorrow black and deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Corytus named of lamentation loud<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Heard on its rueful stream, fierce Phlegethon,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But there was something worse even than this.
The Book of Proverbs shows us that, as in Rome, so
in Jerusalem, foreign immoralities became fatal to the
growing youth. The <i>picta lupa barbara mitrâ</i>, with her
fatal fascinations, and her banquets of which the guests
were in the depths of Hades, became so common in
Jerusalem that no admonitions of the wise were more
needful than those which warned the "simple ones"
that to yield to her seductive snares was to go as an
ox to the slaughter, as a fool to the correction of the
stocks.</p>

<p>5. Even were there no disastrous sequel to Solomon's
story&mdash;if we saw him only in the flush of his early
promise, and the noon of his highest prosperity&mdash;we
could still readily believe that he passed through some
of the experiences of the bitter and sated voluptuary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
who borrows his name in the Book of Ecclesiastes.
The human pathos, the fresh and varied interest, which
meet us at every page of the annals of David, are
entirely lacking in the magnificent monotony of the
annals of Solomon. The splendours of materialism,
which are mainly dwelt upon, could never satisfy the
poorest of human souls. There are but two broad
gleams of religious interest in his entire story&mdash;the
narrative of his prayer for wisdom, and the prayer, in
its present form of later origin, attributed to him at
the Dedication Festival. All the rest is a story of
gorgeous despotism, which gradually paled into</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The dim grey life and apathetic end."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"There was no king like Solomon: he exceeded all
the kings of the earth," we are told, "for riches and for
wisdom." But all that we know of such kings furnishes
fresh proof of the universal experience that "the kingdoms
of the world and the glory of them" are absolutely
valueless for all the contributions they can lend to
human happiness. The autocrats who have been most
conspicuous for unchecked power and limitless resources
have also been the most conspicuous in misery. We
have but to recall Tiberius "<i>tristissimus ut constat
hominum</i>," who, from the enchanted isle which he had
degraded into the stye of his infamies, wrote to his
servile senate that "all the gods and goddesses were
daily destroying him"; or Septimius Severus, who,
rising step by step from a Dalmatian peasant and
common soldier to be emperor of the world, remarked
with pathetic conviction, "<i>Omnia fui et nihil expedit</i>";
or Abderrahman the Magnificent, who, in all his life of
success and prosperity, could only count fourteen happy
days; or Charles V., over-eating himself in his monastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
retreat at San Yuste in Estremadura; or Alexander,<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>
dying "as a fool dieth"; or Louis XIV., surrounded
by a darkening horizon, and disillusioned into infinite
<i>ennui</i> and chagrin; or Napoleon I., saying, "I regard
life with horror," and contrasting his "abject misery"
with the adored and beloved dominion of Christ, who
was meek and lowly of heart. Napoleon confessed
that, even in the zenith of his empire, and the fullest
flush of his endless victories, his days were consumed
in vanity and his years in trouble. The cry of one and
all, finding that the soul, which is infinite, cannot be
satisfied with the transient and hollow boons of earth,
is, and ever must be, "Vanity of vanities, saith the
Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity." And this
is one main lesson of the life of Solomon. Nothing
is more certain than that, if earthly happiness is to be
found at all, it can only be found in righteousness and
truth; and if even these do not bring earthly <i>happiness</i>
they securely give us a <i>blessedness</i> which is deeper and
more eternal.</p>

<p>If the Book of Ecclesiastes, even traditionally, is the
reflection and echo of Solomon's disenchantment, we
see that in later years his soul had been sullied, his
faith had grown dim, his fervour cold. All was emptiness.
He stood horribly alone. His one son was not
a wise man, but a fool. Gewgaws could no longer satisfy
him. His wealth exhausted, his fame tarnished, his
dominions reduced to insignificance, himself insulted
by contemptible adversaries whom he could neither
control nor punish, he entered on the long course of
years "<i>plus pâles et moins couronnées</i>." The peaceful
is harried by petty raids; the magnificent is laden with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
debts; the builder of the Temple has sanctioned polytheism;
the favourite of the nation has become a
tyrant, scourging with whips an impatient people; the
"darling of the Lord" has built shrines for Moloch
and Astarte. The glamour of youth, of empire, of
gorgeous tyranny was dispelled, and the splendid boy-king
is the weary and lonely old man. Hiram of Tyre
has turned in disgust from an ungenerous recompense.
A new Pharaoh has dispossessed his Egyptian father-in-law
and shelters his rebel servant. His shameful harem
has given him neither a real home nor a true love; his
commerce has proved to be an expensive failure; his
politic alliances a hollow sham. In another and direr
sense than after his youthful vision, "Solomon awoke,
and behold it was a dream."<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>The Talmudists show some insight amid their fantasies
when they write: "At first, before he married
strange wives, Solomon reigned over the angels
(1 Chron. xxix. 23); then only over all kingdoms
(1 Kings iv. 21); then only over Israel (Eccles. i. 12);
then only over Jerusalem (Eccles. i. 1). At last he
reigned only over his staff&mdash;as it is said, 'And this was
the portion of my labour'; for by the word '<i>this</i>,'" says
Rav, "he meant that the only possession left to him
was the staff which he held in his hand." The staff
was not "the rod and staff" of the Good Shepherd,
but the earthly staff of pride and pomp, and (as in the
Arabian legend) the worm of selfishness and sensuality
was gnawing at its base.</p>

<p>Solomon had endeavoured to give a one-sided
development to Israelitish nationality, and a development
little in accord with the highest and purest
traditions of the people. What he did with one hand
by building the Temple he undid with the other by
endowing and patronising the worship of heathen
deities.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> In point of fact, Solomon was hardly a genuine
off-shoot of the stem of Jesse. It is at least doubtful
whether Bathsheba was of Hebrew race, and from her
he may have derived an alien strain. It is at all events
a striking fact that, so far from being regarded as an
ideal Hebrew king, he was rather the reverse. The
chronicler, indeed, exalts him as the supporter and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
redintegrator of the Priestly-Levitic system, which it
is the main object of that writer to glorify; but this
picture of theocratic purity, even if it be not altogether
an anachronism, is only obtained by the total suppression
of every incident in the story of Solomon which
militates against it. In the Book of Kings we are
faithfully told of the disgust of Hiram at the reward
offered to him; of the alienation of a fertile district of
the promised land; of the apostasy, the idolatries, and
the reverses which disgraced and darkened his later
years. The Book of Chronicles ignores every one of
these disturbing particulars. It does not tell us of the
depths to which Solomon fell, though it tells us of the
extreme scrupulosity which regarded as a profanation
the residence of his Egyptian queen on the hill once
hallowed as the resting-place of Jehovah's Ark. Yet,
if we understand in their simple sense the statements
of the editor of the Book of Kings, and the documents
on which he based his narrative, Solomon, even at the
Dedication Festival, ignored all distinction between
the priesthood and the laity. Nay, more than this, he
seems to have offered, with his own hands, both burnt
offerings and peace offerings three times a year,<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> and,
unchecked by priestly opposition or remonstrance, to
have "burnt incense before the altar that was before
the Lord," though, according to the chronicler, it was
for daring to attempt this that Uzziah was smitten with
the horrible scourge of leprosy.</p>

<p>The ideal of a good and great king is set before us
in the Book of Proverbs, and in many respects Solomon
fell very far short of it. Further than this, there are
in Scripture two warning sketches of everything which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
a good king should <i>not</i> be and should <i>not</i> do, and
these sketches exactly describe the very things which
Solomon was and did. Those who take the view that
the books of Scripture have undergone large later
revision, see in each of these passages an unfavourable
allusion to the king who raised Israel highest amongst
the nations, only to precipitate her disintegration and
ruin, and who combined the highest service to the
centralisation of her religion with the deadliest insult
to its supreme claim upon the reverence of the world.</p>

<p>1. The first of these pictures of selfish autocrats
is found in 1 Sam. viii. 10-18:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto
the people that asked of Him a king. And he said,
This will be the manner of the king that shall reign
over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them
for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen;
and some shall run before his chariots. And he will
appoint his captains over thousands, and captains over
fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap
his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and
instruments of his chariots. And he will take your
daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to
be bakers. And he will take your fields, and your
vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them,
and give them to his servants. And he will take the
tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give
to his courtiers, and to his servants. And he will
take your menservants and your maidservants, and
your goodliest oxen, and your asses, and put them to
his work. He will take the tenth of your sheep, and
you shall be his servants. And ye shall cry out in that
day because of your king which ye shall have chosen
you; and the Lord will not hear you in that day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The other, which is still more detailed and significant,
was perhaps written with the express intention
of warning Solomon's descendants from the example
which Solomon had set.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> It is found in Deut. xvii.
14-20. Thus, speaking of a king, the writer says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor
cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that
he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the Lord
hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more
that way. Neither shall he multiply wives to himself;
that his heart turn not away; neither shall he greatly
multiply to himself silver and gold. And it shall
be that when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom,
that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book ...
that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, ... that
his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that
he turn not aside from the commandment, ... to the
end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he,
and his children, in the midst of Israel."</p>

<p>If Deuteronomy be of no older date than the days
of Josiah, it is difficult not to see in this passage
a distinct polemic against Solomon; for he did not
do what he is here commanded, and he most conspicuously
did every one of the things which is here
forbidden.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that in his foreign alliances, in his
commerce, in his cavalry, in his standing army, in his
extravagant polygamy, in his exaggerated and exhausting
magnificence, in his despotic autocracy, in his
palatial architecture, and in his patronage of alien<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
art, in his system of enforced labour, in his perilous
religious syncretism, Solomon was by no means a king
after the hearts of the old faithful and simple Israelites.
They did not look with entire favour even on the
centralisation of worship in a single Temple which
interfered with local religious rites sanctioned by the
example of their greatest prophets. His ideal differed
entirely from that of the older patriarchs. He gave to
the life of his people an alien development; he obliterated
some of their best national characteristics; and
the example which he set was at least as powerful
for evil as for good.</p>

<p>When we read the lofty sentiments expressed by
Solomon in his dedication prayer, we may well be
amazed to hear that one who had aspirations so sublime
could sink into idolatry so deplorable. If it was the
object of the chronicler to present Solomon in unsullied
splendour, he might well omit the deadly circumstance
that when he was old, and prematurely old, "he loved
many strange women, and <i>went after Ashtoreth the
goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination
of the Ammonites</i>.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> <i>And Solomon did evil in the
sight of the Lord, and went not fully after the Lord as did
David his father. Then did Solomon build a high place
for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is
before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the
children of Ammon.</i><a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> <i>And likewise did he for all his
strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto
their gods.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>The sacred historian not only records the shameful
fact, but records its cause and origin. The heart of
Solomon was perverted, his will was weakened, his
ideal was dragged into the mire by the "strange
wives" who crowded his seraglio. He went the way
that destroys kings.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> The polygamy of Solomon
sprang naturally from the false position which he
had created for himself. A king who puts a space of
awful distance between himself and the mass of his
subjects&mdash;a king whose will is so absolute that life is
in his smile and death in his frown&mdash;is inevitably
punished by the loneliest isolation. He may have
favourites, he may have flatterers, but he can have no
friends. A thronged harem becomes to him not only
a matter of ostentation and luxury, but a necessary
resource from the vacuity and <i>ennui</i> of a desolate heart.
Tiberius was driven to the orgies of Capreæ by the
intolerableness of his isolation. The weariness of the
king who used to take his courtiers by the button-hole
and say, "<i>Ennuyons-nous ensemble</i>," drove him to fill
up his degraded leisure in the <i>Parc aux Cerfs</i>. Yet
even Louis XV. had more possibilities of rational intercourse
with human beings than a Solomon or a Xerxes.
It was in the nature of things that Solomon, when he
had imitated all the other surroundings of an Oriental
despot, should sink, like other Oriental despots, from
sensuousness into sensualism, from sensualism into
religious degeneracy and dishonourable enervation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>
<p>Two facts, both full of warning, are indicated as the
sources of his ruin: (1) the number of his wives; and
(2) their heathen extraction.</p>

<p>1. "He had," we are told, "seven hundred wives,
princesses, and three hundred concubines."<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>The numbers make up a thousand, and are almost
incredible. We are told indeed that in the monstrosities
of Indian absolutism the Great Mogul had a thousand
wives; but even Darius, "the king" <i>par excellence</i>, the
awful autocrat of Persia, had only one wife and thirty-two
concubines.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> It is inconceivable that the monarch
of a country so insignificant as Palestine could have
maintained so exorbitant a household in a small city
like Jerusalem. Moreover, there is, on every ground,
reason to correct the statement. Saul, so far as we
know, had only one wife, and one concubine; David,
though he put so little restraint on himself, had only
sixteen; no subsequent king of Israel or Judah appears
to have had even a small fraction of the number which
is here assigned to Solomon, either by the disease of
exaggeration or by some corruption of the text. More
probably we should read seventy wives, which at least
partially assimilates the number to the "threescore
queens" of whom we read in the Canticles.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Even
then we have a household which must have led to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
miserable complications. The seraglio at Jerusalem
must have been a burning fiery furnace of feuds,
intrigues, jealousies, and discontent. It is this fact
which gives additional meaning to the Song of Songs.
That unique book of Scripture is a sweet idyll in
honour of pure and holy love. It sets before us in
glowing imagery and tender rhythms how the lovely
maiden of Shunem, undazzled by all the splendours
and luxuries of the great king's court, unseduced by
his gifts and his persistence, remained absolutely
faithful to her humble shepherd lover, and, amid the
gold and purple of the palace at Jerusalem, sighed for
her simple home amid the groves of Lebanon. Surely
she was as wise as fair, and her chances of happiness
would be a thousandfold greater, her immunities from
intolerable conditions a thousandfold more certain, as
she wandered hand in hand with her shepherd youth
amid pure scenes and in the vernal air, than amid the
heavy exotic perfumes of a sensual and pampered
court.</p>

<p>Perhaps in the word "princesses" we see some
sort of excuse for that effeminating self-indulgence
which would make the exhortations to simplicity and
chastity in the Book of Proverbs sound very hollow
on the lips of Solomon. It may have been worldly
policy which originally led him to multiply his
wives. The alliance with Pharaoh was secured by
a marriage with his daughter, and possibly that with
Hiram by the espousal of a Tyrian princess. The
friendliness of Edom on the south, of Moab and
Ammon on the east, of Sidon and the Hittites and
Syria on the north, might be enhanced by matrimonial
connexions from which the greater potentates
might profit and of which the smaller sheykhs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
were proud.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Yet if this were so, the policy, like all
other worldly policy unsanctioned by the law of
God, was very unsuccessful. Egypt as usual proved
herself to be a broken reed. The Hittites only preserved
a dream and legend of their olden power. Edom
and Moab neither forgot nor abandoned their implacable
and immemorial hatred. Syria became a dangerous
rival awaiting the day of future triumphs. "It is better
to trust in the Lord than to put any confidence in
man; it is better to trust in the Lord than to put
any confidence in princes."</p>

<p>2. But the heathen religion of these strange
women from so many nations "turned away the heart
of Solomon after other gods." It may be doubted
whether Solomon had ever read the stern prohibitions
against intermarriage with the Canaanite nations which
now stand on the page of the Pentateuch. If so he
broke them, for the Hittites and the Ph&#339;nicians were
Canaanites. Marriages with Egyptians, Moabites, and
Edomites had not been, in so many words, forbidden,
but the feeling of later ages applied the rule analogously
to them. The result proved how necessary the law
was. When Solomon was old his heart was no longer
proof against feminine wiles. He was not old in
years, for this was some time before his death, and
when he died he was little more than sixty. But a
polygamous despot gets old before his time.</p>

<p>The attempt made by Ewald and others to gloss
over Solomon's apostasy as a sign of a large-hearted
tolerance is an astonishing misreading of history.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Tolerance for harmless divergences of opinion there
should always be, though it is only a growth of modern
days; but tolerance for iniquity is a wrong to holiness.</p>

<p>The worship of these devils adored for deities was
stained with the worst passions which degrade human
nature. They were themselves the personification of
perverted instincts. The main facts respecting them
are collected in Selden's famous <i>De Dis Syris Syntagma</i>,
and Milton has enshrined them in his stateliest verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>What tolerance should there be for idols whose
service was horrible infanticide and shameless lust?
"What fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?
and what communion hath light with darkness?
and what concord hath Christ with an infidel? and what
agreement hath the temple of God with idols?" How
vile the worship of Chemosh was, Israel had already
experienced in the wilderness where he was called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
Peor.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> What Moloch was they were to learn thereafter
by many a horrible experience. Had Solomon
never heard that the Lord God was a jealous God,
and would not tolerate the rivalries of gods of fire and
of lust? At least he was not afraid to desecrate one,
if not two, of the summits of the Mount of Olives with
shrines to these monstrous images, which seem to have
been left "on that opprobrious mount" for many an
age, so that they "durst abide"</p>

<p>And, to crown all, Solomon not only showed this
guilty complaisance to <i>all</i> his strange wives, but even,
sinking into the lowest abyss of apostasy, "burnt
incense and sacrificed unto their gods."</p>

<p>"He that built a temple for himself and for Israel
in Sion," says Bishop Hall, "built a temple for Chemoch
in the Mount of Scandal for his mistresses in the very
face of God's house. Because Solomon feeds them in
their superstition, he draws the sin home to himself,
and is branded for what he should have forbidden."</p>

<p>Such degeneracy could not show itself in the king
without danger to his people. "<i>Delirant reges,

power and the general disenchantment from the glamour
of his magnificence, the land became full of corruption

youths.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> The simple and joyous agricultural
prosperity in which the sons of the people grew up
as young plants and their daughters as the polished
corners of the Temple was replaced by struggling
discontent and straining competition. And amid all
these evils the voices of the courtly priests were
silent, and for a long time, under the menacing and
irresponsible dominance of an oracular royalty, there
was no prophet more.</p>

<p>Early in Solomon's reign two adversaries had declared
their existence, but only became of much account in
the darker and later days of its decline.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>One of these was Hadad, Prince of Edom. Upon
the Edomites in the days of David the prowess of Joab
had inflicted an overwhelming and all but exterminating
reverse. Joab had remained six months in the
conquered district to bury his comrades who had been
slain in the terrible encounter, and to extirpate as far
as possible the detested race. But the king's servants
had been able to save Hadad, then but a little child,
from the indiscriminate massacre, as the sole survivor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
of his house.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> The young Edomite prince was conveyed
by them through Midian and the desert of Paran into
Egypt, and there, for political reasons, had been kindly
received by the Pharaoh of the day, probably Pinotem I.
of the Tanite dynasty, the father of Psinaces whose
alliance Solomon had secured by marriage with his
daughter. Pinotem not only welcomed the fugitive
Edomite as the last scion of a kingly race, but even
deigned to bestow on him the hand of the sister of
Tahpenes, his own <i>Gebira</i> or queen-mother.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> Their
son Genubath was brought up among the Egyptian
princes. But amid the luxurious splendours of Pharaoh's
palace Hadad carried in his heart an undying thirst for
vengeance on the destroyer of his family and race. The
names of David and Joab inspired a terror which made
rebellion impossible for a time; but when Hadad heard,
with grim satisfaction, of Joab's judicial murder, and
that David had been succeeded by a peaceful son, no
charm of an Egyptian palace and royal bride could
weigh in the balance against the fierce passion of an
avenger of blood. Better the wild freedom of Idumea
than the sluggish ease of Egypt. He asked the
Pharaoh's leave to return to his own country, and,
braving the reproach of ingratitude, made his way back
to the desolated fields and cities of his unfortunate
people.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> He developed their resources, and nursed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
their hopes of the coming day of vengeance. If he
could do nothing else he could at least act as a
desperate marauder, and prove himself a "satan" to
the successor of his foe.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> Solomon was strong enough
to keep open the road to Ezion-Gebir, but Hadad
was probably master of Sela and Maon.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>Another enemy was Rezon, of whom but little is
known. David had won a great victory, the most
remarkable of all his successes, over Hadadezer, King
of Zobah, and had then signalised his conquest by
placing garrisons in Syria of Damascus. On this
occasion Rezon, the son of Eli, who is perhaps identical
with Hezion, the grandfather of Benhadad, King of
Syria in the days of Asa, fled from the host of Hadadezer
with some of the Syrian forces. With these and
all whom he could collect about him, he became a
guerilla captain. After a successful period of predatory
warfare he found himself strong enough to seize
Damascus, where, to all appearance, he founded a
powerful hereditary kingdom. Thus with Hadad in
the south to plunder his commercial caravans, and
Rezon on the north to threaten his communication with
Tiphsah, and alarm his excursions to his pleasances in
Lebanon, Solomon was made keenly to feel that his
power was rather an unsubstantial pageant than a solid
dominion.</p>

<p>The enmity of these powerful Emirs of Edom and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Syria was an hereditary legacy from the wars of
David and the ruthless savagery of Joab. A third
adversary was far more terrible, and he was called
into existence by the conduct of Solomon himself.
This was Jeroboam, the son of Nebat. In himself he
was of no account, being a man of isolated position
and obscure origin. He was the son of a widow
named Zeruah,<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> who lived at Zarthan in the Jordan
valley. The position of a widow in the ancient world
was one of feebleness and difficulty; and if we may
trust the apocryphal additions to the Septuagint,
Zeruah was not only a widow but a harlot. But
Jeroboam, whose name perhaps indicates that he was
born in the golden days of Solomon's prosperity, was
a youth of vigour and capacity. He made his way
from the wretched clay fields of Zeredah to Jerusalem,
and there became one of the vast undistinguished gang
who were known as "slaves of Solomon." The <i>corvée</i>
of many thousands from all parts of Palestine was
then engaged in building the <i>Millo</i> and the huge walls
and causeway in the valley between Zion and Moriah,
which was afterwards known as the Valley of the
Cheesemongers (<i>Tyrop&#339;on</i>). Here the unknown youth
distinguished himself by his strenuousness, and by the
influence which he rapidly acquired. Solomon knew
the value of a man "diligent in his business," and
therefore worthy to stand before kings. Untrammelled
by any rules of seniority, and able to make and unmake
as he thought fit, Solomon promoted him while
still young, and at one bound, to a position of great
rank and influence. Jeroboam was an Ephraimite, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
Solomon therefore "gave him charge over all the
compulsory levies (<i>Mas</i>) of the tribe of the house of
Joseph"&mdash;that is, of the proud and powerful tribes of
Ephraim and Manasseh, who practically represented all
Israel except Judah, Benjamin, and the almost nominal
Simeon.</p>

<p>The spark of ambition was now kindled in the
youth's heart, and as he toiled among the workmen he
became aware of two secrets of deadly import to the
master who had lifted him out of the dust&mdash;secrets
which he well knew how to use. One was that a deep
undercurrent of tribal jealousy was setting in with the
force of a tide. Solomon had unduly favoured his
own tribe by exemptions from the general requisition,
and Ephraim fretted under a sense of wrong. That
proud tribe, the heir of Joseph's pre-eminence, had
never acquiesced in the loss of the hegemony which
it so long had held. From Ephraim had sprung
Joshua, the mighty successor of Moses, the conqueror
of the Promised Land, and his sepulchre was still
among them at Timnath-Serah. From their kith had
sprung the princely Gideon, the greatest of the judges,
who might, had he so chosen, have anticipated the
foundation of royalty in Israel. Shiloh, which God
had chosen for His inheritance, was in their domains.
It required very little at any time to make the Ephraimites
second the cry of the insurgents who followed
Sheba, the son of Bichri,&mdash;</p>

<p>
"We have no part in David,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Every man to his tents, O Israel."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Jeroboam, who was now by Solomon's favour a chief
ruler over his fellow-tribesmen, had many opportunities
to foment this jealousy, and to win for himself by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
personal graciousness the popularity of Solomon which
had so long begun to wane.</p>

<p>But a yet deeper feeling was at work against Solomon.
The men of Ephraim and all the northern tribes had
not only begun to ask why Judah was to monopolise
the king's partiality, but the much more dangerous
question, What right has the king to enforce on us
these dreary and interminable labours, in making a city
of palaces and an impregnable fortress of a capital which
is to overshadow our glory and command our subjection?
With consummate astuteness, by a word here
and a word there, Jeroboam was able to pose before
Solomon as the enforcer of a stern yoke, and before
his countrymen as one who hated the hard necessity
and would fain be their deliverer from it.</p>

<p>And while he was already in heart a rebel against
the House of David, he received what he regarded as
a Divine sanction to his career of ambition.</p>

<p>The prophets, as we have seen, had sunk to silence
before the oracular autocrat who so frequently impressed
on the people that there is "a Divine sentence on the
lips of kings." No special inspiration seemed to be
needed either to correct or to corroborate so infallible
a wisdom. But the heaven-enkindled spark of inspiration
can never be permanently suffocated. Priests as
a body have often proved amenable to royal seductions,
but individual prophets are irrepressible.</p>

<p>What were the priests doing in the face of so fearful
an apostasy? Apparently nothing. They seem to have
sunk into comfortable acquiescence, satisfied with the
augmentation of rank and revenue which the Temple
and its offerings brought to them. They offered no
opposition to the extravagances of the king, his violations
of the theocratic ideal, or even his monstrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
tolerance for the worship of idols. That prophets as
a body existed in Judah during the early years of this
reign there is no proof. The atmosphere was ill-suited
to their vocation. Nathan probably had died long before
Solomon reached his zenith.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> Of Iddo we know almost
nothing. Two prophets are mentioned, but only towards
the close of the reign&mdash;Ahijah of Shiloh,<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> and Shemaiah;
and there seems to have been some confusion in the
<i>rôles</i> respectively assigned to them<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> by later tradition.</p>

<p>But the hour had now struck for a prophet to speak
the word of the Lord. If the king, surrounded by
formidable guards and a glittering court, was too exalted
to be reached by a humble son of the people, it was
time for Ahijah to follow the precedent of Samuel. He
obeyed a divine intimation in selecting the successor
who should punish the great king's rebellion against
God, and inaugurate a rule of purer obedience than
now existed under the upas-shadow of the throne.
He was the <i>Mazkîr</i>, the annalist or historiographer of
Solomon's court (2 Chron. ix. 29); but loyalty to a
backsliding king had come to mean disloyalty to God.
There was but one man who seemed marked out for
the perilous honour of a throne. It was the brave,
vigorous, ambitious youth of Ephraim who had risen to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
high promotion and had won the hearts of his people,
though Solomon had made him the task-master of their
forced labour. On one occasion Jeroboam left Jerusalem,
perhaps to visit his native Zeredah and his
widowed mother.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Ahijah intentionally met him on the
road. He drew him aside from the public path into a
solitary place. There, seen by none, he took off his
own shoulders the new stately <i>abba</i><a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> in which he had
clad himself, and proceeded to give to Jeroboam one of
those object-lessons in the form of an acted parable,
which to the Eastern mind are more effective than any
words.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> Rending the new garment into twelve pieces,
he gave ten to Jeroboam, telling him that Jehovah
would thus rend the kingdom from the hands of Solomon
because of his unfaithfulness, leaving his son but one
tribe<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> that the lamp of David might not be utterly
extinguished. Jeroboam should be king over Israel;
to the House of David should be left but an insignificant
fragment. God would build a sure house for Jeroboam
as He had done for David, if he would keep His commandments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
though the House of David "should not
be afflicted for ever."<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>A scene so memorable, a prophecy of such grave
significance, could hardly remain a secret. Ahijah may
have hinted it among his sympathisers. Jeroboam
would hardly be able to conceal from his friends the
immense hopes which it excited; and as his position
probably gave him the command of troops he became
dangerous. His designs reached the ears of Solomon,
and he sought to put Jeroboam to death. The young
man, who had probably betrayed his secret ambition,
and may even have attempted some premature and
abortive insurrection, escaped from Jerusalem, and
took refuge in Egypt. There the Bubastite dynasty
had displaced the Tanite, and from Shishak I., the
earliest Pharaoh whose individuality eclipsed the
common dynastic name, he received so warm a welcome
that, according to one story, Shishak gave him in
marriage Ano, the elder sister of his Queen Tahpanes
(or Thekemina, LXX.) and of Hadad's wife.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> He
stayed in Egypt till the death of Solomon, and then
returned to Zeredah, either in consequence of the
summons of his countrymen, or that he might be ready
for any turn of events.</p>

<p>Under such melancholy circumstances the last great
king of the united kingdom passed away. Of the
circumstances of his death we are told nothing, but the
clouds had gathered thickly round his declining years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
"The power to which he had elevated Israel," says the
Jewish historian Grätz, "resembled that of a magic
world built up by spirits. The spell was broken at his
death." It must not, however, be imagined that no
abiding results had followed from so remarkable a rule.
The nation which he left behind him at his death was
very different from the nation to whose throne he had
succeeded as a youth. It had sprung from immature
boyhood to the full-grown stature of manhood. If the
purity of its spiritual ideal had been somewhat corrupted,
its intellectual growth and its material power
had been immensely stimulated. It had tasted the
sweets of commerce, and never forgot the richness of
that intoxicating draught which was destined in later
ages to transform its entire nature. Tribal distinctions,
if not obliterated, had been subordinated to a central
organisation. The knowledge of writing had been
more widely spread, and this had led to the dawn of
that literature which saved Israel from oblivion, and
uplifted her to a place of supreme influence among the
nations. Manners had been considerably softened
from their old wild ferocity. The more childish forms
of ancient superstition, such as the use of ephods and
teraphim, had fallen into desuetude. The worship of
Jehovah, and the sense of His unique supremacy over
the whole world, was fostered in many hearts, and men
began to feel the unfitness of giving to Him that name
of "Baal" which began henceforth to be confined to
the Syrian sun-god.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> Amid many aberrations the
sense of religion was deepened among the faithful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Israel, and the ground was prepared for the more
spiritual religion which in later reigns found its immortal
expositors in those Hebrew prophets who rank
foremost among the teachers of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>But as for Solomon himself it is a melancholy thought
that he is one of the three or four of whose salvation
the Fathers and others have openly ventured to doubt.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>
The discussion of such a question is, indeed, wholly
absurd and profitless, and is only here alluded to in
order to illustrate the completeness of Solomon's fall.
As the book of Ecclesiastes is certainly not by him it
can throw no light on the moods of his latter days,
unless it be conceivable that it represents some faint
breath of olden tradition. The early commentators
acquitted or condemned him as though they sat on the
judgment-seat of the Almighty. They would have
shown more wisdom if they had admitted that such
decisions are&mdash;fortunately for all men&mdash;beyond the
scope of human judges. Happily for us God, not
man, is the judge, and He looks down on earth</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With larger other eyes than ours<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To make allowance for us all."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Orcagna was wiser when, in his great picture in the
Campo Santo at Pisa and in the Strozzi Chapel at
Florence, he represented Solomon rising out of his
sepulchre in robe and crown at the trump of the
archangel, uncertain whether he is to turn to the right
hand or to the left.</p>

<p>And Dante, as all men know, joins Solomon in
Paradise with the Four Great Schoolmen. The great
mediæval poet of Latin Christianity did not side with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
St. Augustine and the Latin Fathers against the wise
king, but with St. Chrysostom and the Greek Fathers
for him. He did so because he accepted St. Bernard's
mystical interpretation of the Song of Songs:&mdash;</p>

<p>There is a famous legend in the Qur'an about the
death of Solomon.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>"Work ye righteousness O ye family of David; for
I see that which ye do. And we made the wind subject
unto Solomon.... And we made a fountain of molten
brass to flow for him. And some of the genii were
obliged to work in his presence by the will of his Lord.
They made for him whatever he pleased of palaces, and
statues, and large dishes like fishponds, and caldrons
standing firm on their trivets; and we said, Work
righteousness, O family of David, with thanksgiving;
for few of my servants are thankful. And when we
had decreed that Solomon should die, nothing discovered
his death unto them, except the creeping thing of the
earth that gnawed his staff. And when his body fell
down, the genii plainly perceived that if they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
known that which is secret they had not continued in
a vile punishment."<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p>The legend briefly alluded to was that Solomon
employed the genii to build his Temple, but, foreseeing
that he would die before its completion, he prayed
God to conceal his death from them, so that they
might go on working. His prayer was heard, and
the rest of the legend may best be told in the words
of a poet:<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>The legends of the East describe Solomon as tormented
indeed, yet not without hope. In the romance
of Vathek he is described as listening earnestly to the
roar of a cataract, because when it ceases to roar his
anguish will be at an end.</p>

<p>"The king so renowned for his wisdom was on the
loftiest elevation, and placed immediately beneath the
Dome. 'The thunder,' he said, 'precipitated me hither,
where, however, I do not remain totally destitute of
hope; for an angel of light hath revealed that, in consideration
of the piety of my early youth, my woes shall
come to an end. Till then I am in torments, ineffable
torments; an unrelenting fire preys on my heart.' The
caliph was ready to sink with terror when he heard the
groans of Solomon. Having uttered this exclamation,
Solomon raised his hands towards heaven, in token of
supplication; and the caliph discerned through his
bosom, which was transparent as crystal, his heart
enveloped in flames."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So Solomon passed away&mdash;the last king of all
Palestine till another king arose a thousand years later,
like him in his fondness for magnificence, like him in
his tamperings with idolatry, like him in being the
builder of the Temple, but in all other respects a far
more grievous sinner and a far more inexcusable tyrant&mdash;Herod,
falsely called "The Great."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>And in the same age arose another King of Solomon's
descendants, whose palace was the shop of the carpenter
and His throne the cross, and whose mortal
body was the true Temple of the Supreme&mdash;that King
whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and whose
dominion endureth throughout all ages.</p>

<p>Rehoboam, who was Solomon's only son, succeeded
in Jerusalem without opposition, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 937.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>
But the northern tribes were in no mood to regard as
final the prerogative acceptance of the son of Solomon
by the rival tribe of Judah. David had won them by
his vivid personality; Solomon had dazzled them by
his royal magnificence. It did not follow that they were
blindly to accept a king who emerged for the first time
from the shadow of the harem, and was the son of an
Ammonitess, who worshipped Chemosh. Instead of
going to Rehoboam at Jerusalem as the tribes had
gone to David at Hebron, they summoned an assembly
at their ancient city of Shechem, on the site of the
modern Nablus, between Mount Ebal and Gerizim.
In this fortress-sanctuary they determined, as "men
of Israel," to bring their grievances under the notice
of the new sovereign before they formally ratified his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
succession. According to one view they summoned
Jeroboam, who had already returned to Zeredah, to be
their spokesman.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> When the assembly met they told
the king that they would accept him if he would lighten
the grievous service which his father had put upon
them.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> Rehoboam, taken by surprise, said that they
should receive his answer in "three days." In the
interval he consulted the aged counsellors of his father.
Their answer was astute in its insight into human
nature. It resembled the "long promises, short performance"
which Guido da Montefeltro recommended
to Pope Boniface VIII. in the case of the town of
Penestrino.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> They well understood the maxim of
"<i>omnia serviliter pro imperio</i>," which has paved the way
to power of many a usurper from Otho to Bolingbroke.
"Give the people a civil answer," they said; "tell
them that <i>you</i> are <i>their</i> servant. Content with this
they will be scattered to their homes, and you will
bind them to your yoke for ever." In an answer so
deceptive, but so immoral, the corrupting influence of
the Solomonian autocracy is as conspicuous as in that
of the malapert youths who made their appeal to the
king's conceit.</p>

<p>"Who knoweth whether his son will be a wise man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
or a fool?" asks Solomon in the Book of Proverbs.
Apparently he had done little or nothing to save his
only son from being the latter. Despots in polygamous
households, whether in Palestine or Zululand, live in
perpetual dread of their own sons, and generally keep
them in absolute subordination. If Rehoboam had
received the least political training, or had been possessed
of the smallest common sense, he would have
been able to read the signs of the times sufficiently well
to know that everything might be lost by blustering
arrogance, and everything gained by temporising
plausibility. Had Rehoboam been a man like David,
or even like Saul in his better day, he might have
grappled to himself the affections of his people as with
hooks of steel by seizing the opportunity of abating
their burdens, and offering them a sincere assurance
that he would study their peace and welfare above all.
Had he been a man of ordinary intelligence, he would
have seen that the present was not the moment to
exacerbate a discontent which was already dangerous.
But the worldly-wise counsel of the "elders" of
Solomon was utterly distasteful to a man who, after
long insignificance, had just begun to feel the vertigo
of autocracy. His sense of his right was strong in
exact proportion to his own worthlessness. He turned
to the young men who had grown up with him, and
who stood before him&mdash;the <i>jeunesse dorée</i> of a luxurious
and hypocritical epoch, the aristocratic idlers in whom
the insolent self-indulgence of an enervated society had
expelled the old spirit of simple faithfulness.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> Their
answer was the sort of answer which Buckingham and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Sedley might have suggested to Charles II. in face of the
demands of the Puritans; and it was founded on notions
of inherent prerogative, and "the right Divine of kings to
govern wrong," such as the Bishops might have instilled
into James I. at the Hampton Court Conference, or Archbishop
Laud into Charles I. in the days of "Thorough."</p>

<p>"Threaten this insolent canaille," they said, "with
your royal severity. Tell them that you do not intend
to give up your sacred right to enforced labour, such
as your brother of Egypt has always enjoyed.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> Tell
them that your little finger shall be thicker than your
father's loins,<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> and that instead of his whips you will
chastise them with leaded thongs.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> That is the way
to show yourself every inch a king."</p>

<p>The insensate advice of these youths proved itself
attractive to the empty and infatuated prince. He
accepted it in the dementation which is a presage of
ruin; for, as the pious historian says, "the cause was
from the Lord."</p>

<p>The announcement of this incredibly foolish reply
woke in the men of Israel an answering shout of
rebellion. In the rhythmic war-cry of Sheba, the son
of Bichri, which had become proverbial,<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> they cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"What portion have we in David?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To your tents, O Israel:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Now see to thine own house, David!"<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>Unable to appease the wild tumult, Rehoboam again
showed his want of sense by sending an officer to the
people whose position and personality were most sure
to be offensive to them. He sent "Adoram, who was
over the tribute"&mdash;the man who stood, before the
Ephraimites especially, as the representative of everything
in monarchical government which was to them
most entirely odious. Josephus says that he hoped
to mollify the indignant people. But it was too late.
They stoned the aged <i>Al-ham-Mas</i> with stones that he
died; and when the foolish king witnessed or heard of
the fate of a man who had grown grey as the chief
agent of despotism he felt that it was high time to look
after his own safety. Apparently he had come with no
other escort than that of the men of Judah who formed
a part of the national militia. Of Cherethites, Pelethites,
and Gittites we hear no more. The princeling of a
despoiled and humiliated kingdom was perhaps in no
condition to provide the pay of these foreign mercenaries.
The king found that the name of David was
no longer potent, and that royalty had lost its awful
glamour. He made an effort<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> to reach his chariot, and,
barely succeeding, fled with headlong speed to Jerusalem.
From that day for ever the unity of Israel was
broken, and "the twelve tribes" became a name for
two mutually antagonistic powers.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> The men of Israel
at once chose Jeroboam for their king, and an event<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
was accomplished which had its effect on the history of
all succeeding times. The only Israelites over whom
the House of David continued to rule were those who,
like the scattered remnant of Simeon, dwelt in the
cities of Judah.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p>Thus David's grandson found that his kingdom over
a people had shrunk to the headship of a tribe, with a
sort of nominal suzerainty over Edom and part of
Philistia. He was reduced to the comparative insignificance
of David's own position during his first seven
years, when he was only king in Hebron. This disruption
was the beginning of endless material disasters
to both kingdoms; but it was the necessary condition
of high spiritual blessings, for "it was of the Lord."</p>

<p>Politically it is easy to see that one cause of the revolt
lay in the too great rapidity in which kings, who, as it
was assumed, were to be elective, or at least to depend
on the willing obedience of the people, had transformed
themselves into hereditary despots. Judah might still
accept the sway of a king of her own tribe; but the
powerful and jealous Ephraimites, at the head of the
Northern Confederation, refused to regard themselves
as the destined footstool for a single family. As in the
case of Saul and of David, they determined once more
to accept no king who did not owe his sovereignty to
their own free choice.</p>

<h3><i>THE DISRUPTION.</i></h3>

<p class="center">1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> xii. 6-20.</p>


<p>"<i>It was of the Lord.</i>" It is no small proof of the
insight and courageous faithfulness of the historian
that he accepts without question the verdict of ancient
prophecy that the disruption was God's doing; for
everything which happened in the four subsequent
centuries, alike in Judah and in Israel, seemed to belie
this pious conviction. We, in the light of later history,
are now able to see that the disseverance of Israel's
unity worked out results of eternal advantage to
mankind; but in the sixth century before Christ no
event could have seemed to be so absolutely disastrous.
It must have worn the aspect of an extinction of the
glory of the House of Jacob. It involved the obliteration
of the great majority of the descendants of the
patriarchs, and the reduction of the rest to national
insignificance and apparently hopeless servitude.
Throughout those centuries of troubled history, in
the struggle for existence which was the lot of both
kingdoms alike, it was difficult to say whether their
antagonism or their friendship, their open wars or their
matrimonial alliances, were productive of the greater
ruin. Each section of the nation fatally hampered and
counterpoised the other with a perpetual rivalry and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
menace. Ephraim envied Judah, and Judah vexed
Ephraim. In extreme cases the south was ready to
purchase the intervention of Syria, or even of Assyria,
to check and overwhelm its northern rival, while the
north could raise up Egypt or Edom to harass the
southern kingdom with intolerable raids.</p>

<p>To us the Southern Kingdom, the kingdom of Judah,
seems the more important and the more interesting
division of the people. It became the heir of all the
promises, the nurse of the Messianic hope, the mother
of the four greater prophets, the continuer of all the
subsequent history after the glory of Israel had been
stamped out by Assyria for ever.</p>

<p>1. But such was not the aspect presented by the
kingdom of Judah to contemporary observers. On the
contrary, Judah seemed to be a paltry and accidental
fragment&mdash;one tribe, dissevered from the magnificent
unity of Israel. Nothing redeemed it from impotence
and obliteration but the splendid possessions of
Jerusalem and the Temple, which guaranteed the
often threatened perpetuity of the House of David.
The future seemed to be wholly with Israel when men
compared the relative size and population of the disunited
tribes. Judah comprised little more than the
environs of Jerusalem. Except Jerusalem, Mizpeh,
Gibeon, and Hebron, it had no famous shrines and
centres of national traditions. It could not even
claim the southern town of Beersheba as a secure
possession.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> The tribe of Simeon had melted away
into a shadow, if not into non-existence, amid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
surrounding populations, and its territory was under
the kings of Judah; but they did not even possess
the whole of Benjamin, and if that little tribe was
nominally reckoned with them, it was only because
part of their capital city was in Benjamite territory,
to which belonged the valley of Hinnom. To Israel,
on the other hand, pertained all the old local sanctuaries
and scenes of great events. On the east of Jordan
they held Mahanaim; on the west Jericho, near as it
was to Jerusalem, and Bethel with its sacred stone of
Jacob, and Gilgal with its memorial of the conquest,
and Shechem the national place of assembly, and Accho
and Joppa on the sea shore. Israel, too, inherited all
the predominance over Moab and Ammon, and the
Philistines, which had been secured by conquest in
the reign of David.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>2. Then, again, the greatest heroes of tradition had
been sons of the northern tribes. The fame of Joshua
was theirs, of Deborah and Barak, of fierce Jephthah,
of kingly Gideon, and of bold Abimelech. Holy Samuel,
the leader of the prophets, and heroic Saul, the first of
the kings, had been of their kith and kin. Judah could
only claim the bright personality of David, and the
already tarnished glories of Solomon, which men did
not yet see through the mirage of legend but in the
prosaic light of every day.</p>

<p>3. Again, the Northern Kingdom was unhampered
by the bad example and erroneous development of the
preceding royalty. Jeroboam had not stained his
career with crimes like David; nor had he sunk, as
Solomon had done, into polygamy and idolatry. It
seemed unlikely that he, with so fatal an example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
before his eyes, could be tempted into oppressive
tyranny, futile commerce, or luxurious ostentation.
He could found a new dynasty, free from the trammels
of a bad commencement, and as fully built on Divine
command as that of the House of Jesse.</p>

<p>4. Nor was it a small advantage that the new
kingdom had an immense superiority over its southern
compeer in richness of soil and beauty of scenery. To
it belonged the fertile plain of Jezreel, rolling with
harvests of golden grain. Its command of Accho gave
it access to the treasures of the shore and of the sea.
To it belonged the purple heights of Carmel, of which
the very name meant "a garden of God"; and the
silver Lake of Galilee, with its inexhaustible swarms
of fish; and the fields of Gennesareth, which were a
wonder of the world for their tropical luxuriance.
Theirs also were the lilied waters and paper-reeds of
Merom, and the soft, green, park-like scenery of Gerizim,
and the roses of Sharon, and the cedars of Lebanon,
and the vines and fig trees and ancient terebinths of
all the land of Ephraim, and the forest glades of
Zebulon and Naphtali, and the wild uplands beyond
the Jordan&mdash;which were all far different from the
"awful barrenness" of Judah, with its monotony of
rounded hills.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p>5. Under these favourable conditions three great advantages
were exceptionally developed in the Northern
Kingdom.</p>

<p>(1) It evidently enjoyed a larger freedom as well as a
greater prosperity. How gay and bright, how festive
and musical, how worldly and luxurious, was the life
of the wealthy and the noble in the ivory palaces and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
on the gorgeous divans of Samaria and Jezreel, as we
read of it in the pages of the contemporary prophets!<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>
Naboth and Shemer show themselves as independent
of tyranny as any sturdy dalesman or feudal noble,
and "the great lady of Shunem, on the slopes of
Esdraelom, in her well-known home, is a sample of
Israelite life in the north as true as that of the reaper
Boaz in the south. She leaves her home under the
pressure of famine, and goes down to the plains of
Philistia. When she returns and finds a stranger in
her corn-fields, she insists on restitution, even at the
hand of the king himself."<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<p>(2) The Ten Tribes also developed a more brilliant
literature. Some of the most glowing psalms are
probably of northern origin, as well as the Song of
Deborah, and the work of the writer who is now
generally recognised by critics under the name of
the Deuteronomist. The loveliest poem produced by
Jewish literature&mdash;the Song of Songs&mdash;bears on every
page the impress of the beautiful and imaginative north.
The fair girl of Shunem loves her leopard-haunted
hills, and the vernal freshness of her northern home,
more than the perfumed chambers of Solomon's seraglio;
and her poet is more charmed with the lustre and
loveliness of Tirzah than with the palaces and Temple
of Jerusalem. The Book of Job may have originated
in the Northern Kingdom, from which also sprang the
best historians of the Jewish race.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p>(3) But the main endowment of the new kingdom
consisted in the magnificent development and independence
of the prophets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not till after the overthrow of the Ten Tribes
that the glory of prophecy migrated southwards, and
Jerusalem produced the mighty triad of Isaiah, Jeremiah,
and Ezekiel. For the two and a half centuries
that the Northern Kingdom lasted scarcely one prophet
is heard of in Judah except the scarcely known Hanani,
and Eliezer, the son of Mareshah,<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> who is little more
than a <i>nominis umbra</i>. To the north belongs the great
herald-prophet of the Old Dispensation, the mighty
Elijah; the softer spirit of the statesman-prophet Elisha;
the undaunted Micaiah, son of Imlah; the picturesque
Micah; the historic Jonah; the plaintive Hosea; and
that bold and burning patriot, a fragment of whose
prophecy now forms part of the Book of Zechariah.
Amos, indeed, belonged by birth to Tekoa, which was
in Judah, but his prophetic activity was confined to
Bethel and Jezreel. The Schools of the Prophets at
Ramah, Bethel, Jericho, and Gilgal were all in Israel.
The passages in the third section of the Book of
Zechariah are alone sufficient to show how vast was
the influence in the affairs of the nation of the prophets
of the north, and how fearless their intervention. Even
when they were most fiercely persecuted, they were
not afraid to beard the most powerful kings&mdash;an Ahab
and a Jeroboam II.&mdash;in all their pride.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> Samaria and
Galilee were rich in prophetic lives; and they, too, were
the destined scene of the life of Him of whom all the
prophets prophesied, and from whose inspiration they
drew their heavenly fire.</p>

<p>Against these advantages, however, must be set two
serious and ultimately fatal drawbacks&mdash;germs of disease
which lay in the very constitution of the kingdom, and
from the first doomed it to death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>One of these was the image-worship, of which I shall
speak in a later section; the other was the lack of one
predominant and continuous dynasty.</p>

<p>The royalty of the north did not spring up through
long years of gradual ascendency, and could not originally
appeal to splendid services and heroic memories.
Jeroboam was a man of humble, and, if tradition says
truly, of tainted origin. He was not a usurper, for he
was called to the throne by the voice of prophecy
and the free spontaneous choice of his people; but in
Solomon's days he had been a potential if not an actual
rebel. He set the example of successful revolt, and it
was eagerly followed by many a soldier and general of
similar antecedents. In the short space of two hundred
and forty-five years there were no less than nine
changes of dynasty, of which those of Jeroboam, Baasha,
Kobolam,<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Menahem, consisted only of a father and son.
There were at least four isolated or partial kings:
Zimri, Tibni, Pekah, and Hosea. Only two dynasties,
those of Omri and Jehu, succeeded in maintaining themselves
for even four or five generations, and they, like
the others, were at last quenched in blood. The close
of the kingdom in its usurpations, massacres, and
catastrophes reminds us of nothing so much as the
disastrous later days of the Roman Empire, when the
purple was so often rent by the dagger-thrust, and it
was rare for emperors to die a natural death. The
kingdom which had risen from a sea of blood set in
the same red waves.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>
<p>On the other hand, whatever may have been the
drawback of the small and hampered Southern Kingdom,
it had several conspicuous advantages. It had a settled
and incomparable capital, which could be rendered
impregnable against all ordinary assaults; while the
capital of the Northern Kingdom shifted from Shechem
to Penuel<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> and Tirzah, and from Tirzah to Samaria
and Jezreel. It had the blessing of a loyal people,
and of the all-but-unbroken continuity of one loved and
cherished dynasty for nearly four centuries. It had
the yet greater blessing of producing not a few kings
who more or less fully attained to the purity of the
theocratic ideal. Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, Josiah,
were good and high-minded kings, and the two latter
were religious reformers. Whatever may have been
the sins and shortcomings of Judah&mdash;and they were
often very heinous&mdash;still the prophets bear witness
that her transgressions were less incurable than those
of her sister Samaria. All good men began to look
to Jerusalem as the nursing mother of the Promised
Deliverer. "Out of Judah," said the later Zechariah,
"shall come forth the corner stone, out of him the nail,
out of him the battle bow, out of him every governor
together."<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> Amos was born in Judah; Hoshea took
refuge there; the later Zechariah laboured (ix., xi.,
xiii. 7-9) for the fusion of the two kingdoms. From
the unknown, or little known, seers who endeavoured
to watch over the infant destinies of Judah, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
mighty prophets who inspired her early resistance to
Assyria, or menaced her apostasy with ruin at the
hands of Babylon, she rarely lacked for any long period
the inspired guidance of moral teachers. If Judah was
for many years behindhand in power, in civilisation, in
literature, even in the splendour of prophetic inspiration,
she still managed on the whole to uplift to the nations
the standard of righteousness. That standard was
often fiercely assaulted, but the standard-bearers did
not faint. The torn remnants of the old ideal were
still upheld by faithful hands. Neither the heathen
tendencies of princes nor the vapid ceremonialism of
priests were allowed unchallenged to usurp the place
of religion pure and undefiled. The later Judæan
prophets, and especially the greatest of them, rose to
a spirituality which had never yet been attained, and
was never again equalled till the rise of the Son of
Righteousness with healing in His wings.</p>

<p>How clearly, then, do we see the truth of the prophetic
announcement that the disruption of the kingdom was
"of the Lord"! Out of apparent catastrophe was
evolved infinite reparation. The abandonment of the
Davidic dynasty of the Ten Tribes looked like earthly
ruin. It did indeed hasten the final overthrow of all
national autonomy; but that would have come in any
case, humanly speaking, from Assyria, or Babylonia,
Persia, or the Seleucids, or the Ptolemies, or Rome.
On the other hand, it fostered a religious power and
concentration which were of more value to the world
than any other blessings. "On all the past greatness
and glory of Israel," says Ewald,<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> "Judah cast its free
and cheerful gaze. Before its kings floated the vision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
of great ancestors; before its prophets examples like
those of Nathan and Gad; before the whole people the
memory of its lofty days. And so it affords us no
unworthy example of the honourable part which may
be played for many centuries in the history of the
world, and the rich blessings which may be imparted,
even by a little kingdom, provided it adheres faithfully
to the eternal truth. The gain to the higher
life of humanity acquired under the earthly protection
of this petty monarchy <i>far outweighs all that has been
attempted or accomplished for the permanent good of
man by many much larger states</i>." "The people of
Israel goes under," says Stade, "but the religion of
Israel triumphs over the powers of the world, while it
changes its character from the religion of a people into
a religion of the world." This development of religion,
as he proceeds to point out, was mainly due to the long,
slow enfeeblement of the people through many centuries,
until at last it had acquired a force which enabled it to
survive the political annihilation of the nationality from
which it sprang.</p>

<p>In reality both kingdoms gained under the appearance
of total loss. "Every people called to high
destinies," says Renan, "ought to be a small complete
world, enclosing opposed poles within its bosom. Greece
had at a few leagues from each other, Sparta and
Athens, two antipodes to a superficial observer, but in
reality rival sisters, necessary the one to the other. It
was the same in Palestine."</p>

<p>The high merit of the historian of the two kingdoms
appears in this, that, without entangling himself in
details, and while he contents himself with sweeping
and summary judgments, he established a moral view
of history which has been ratified by the experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
of the world. He shows us how the tottering and
insignificant kingdom of Judah, secured by God's
promise, and rising through many backslidings into
higher spirituality and faithfulness, not only out-lasted
for a century the overthrow of its far more powerful
rival, but kept alive the torch of faith, and handed it
on to the nations of many centuries across the dust
and darkness of intervening generations. And in
drawing this picture he helped to secure the fulfilment
of his own ideal, for he inspired into many a patriot
and many a reformer the indomitable faith in God
which has enabled men, in age after age, to defy
obloquy and opposition, to face the prison and the
sword, secure in the ultimate victory of God's truth
and God's righteousness amidst the most seemingly
absolute failure, and against the most apparently overwhelming
odds.</p>

<h3>"<i>JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT, WHO MADE
ISRAEL TO SIN.</i>"</h3>

<p class="center">1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> xii. 21-23.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is no
god: yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hosea</span>
viii. 6.</p></blockquote>


<p>The condemnation of the first king of Israel sounds
like a melancholy and menacing refrain through
the whole history of the Northern Kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> Let us
consider the extent and nature of his crime; for though
the condemnation is most true if we judge merely by
the issue of Jeroboam's acts, a man's guilt cannot always
be measured by the immensity of its unforeseen consequences,
nor can his actions and intentions be always
fairly judged after the lapse of centuries. The moral
judgments recorded in the Book of Kings concerning
legal and ritual offences are measured by the standard
of men's consciences nearly a century after Josiah's
Reformation in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 623, not by that which prevailed in
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 937, when Jeroboam came to the throne. It seems
clear that, even in the opinion of his contemporaries,
Jeroboam was unfaithful to the duties of the call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
which he had received from God; but it would be an
error to suppose that his sin was, in itself, so heinous
as those of which both Solomon and Rehoboam and
other kings of Judah were guilty. "Calf-worship," as
it was contemptuously called in later days, did not
present itself as "calf-worship" to Jeroboam or his
people. To them it was only the more definite adoration
of Jehovah under the guise of the cherubic emblem
which Solomon had himself enshrined in the Temple
and Moses himself had sanctioned in the Tabernacle.
There is not a word to show that they were cognisant
of the book which had narrated the fierce reprobation
by Moses of Aaron's "golden calf" in the wilderness.
Jeroboam's chief sin was not that as a king he tolerated,
or even set up, a sort of idolatry, but that he induced
the whole body of his subjects to share in his evil
innovations.</p>

<p>The charge brought against him was threefold.
First, he set up the golden calves at Dan and Bethel.
Secondly, he "made priests from among all the people,
which were not of the sons of Levi." Thirdly, he
established his "harvest feast" not on the fifteenth day
of the seventh month, which was the Feast of Tabernacles,
but on the fifteenth day of the eighth month.
In estimating these sins let us endeavour&mdash;for it is a
sacred duty&mdash;to be just.</p>

<p>1. We read in the Authorised Version that "he made
priests of <i>the lowest</i> of the people,"<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> and this tends to
increase the prejudice against him. But to have done
this wilfully would have been entirely against his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
interests. The more honourable his priests were, the
more was his new worship likely to succeed. The
Hebrew only says that "he made priests of all classes
of the people," or, as the Revised Version renders it,
"from among all the people." No doubt this would
appear to have been a heinous innovation, judged from
the practice of later ages; it is not clear that it was
equally so in the days of Jeroboam. If David, unrebuked,
made his sons priests; if Ira the Ithrite was
a priest; if Solomon, by his own fiat, altered the succession
of the priesthood; if Solomon (no less than
Jeroboam) arrogated to himself priestly functions on
public occasions, the opinion as to priestly rights may
not have existed in the days of Jeroboam, or may only
have existed in an infinitely weaker form than in the
days of the post-exilic chronicler. An incidental notice
in another book shows us that in Dan, at any rate, he
did <i>not</i> disturb the Levitic ministry. There the descendants
of Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the grandson
of Moses,<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> continued their priestly functions from the
day when that unworthy descendant of the mighty
lawgiver was seduced to conduct a grossly irregular
cult for a few shillings a year, down to the day when
the golden calf at Dan was carried away by Tiglath-Pileser,
King of Assyria. If the Levites preferred to
abide by the ministrations of Jerusalem, and migrated
in large numbers to the south, Jeroboam may have
held that necessity compelled him to appoint priests
who were not of the House of Levi. Neither for this,
nor for his new feast of Tabernacles, nor for the calf-worship,
were the kings of Israel condemned (so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
as is recorded) even by such mighty prophets as Elijah
and Elisha.</p>

<p>In choosing Dan and Bethel as the seats for his new
altars, the king was not actuated by purely arbitrary
considerations. They were ancient and venerated
shrines of pilgrimage and worship (Judg. xviii. 30,
xx. 18, 26; 1 Sam. x. 3). He did not create any
sacredness which was not already attached to them
in the popular imagination.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> In point of fact he would
have served the ends of a worldly policy much better
if he had chosen Shechem; for Dan and Bethel were
the two farthest parts of his kingdom. Dan was in
constant danger from the Syrians, and Bethel, which
is only twelve miles from Jerusalem, more than once
fell into the hands of the kings of Judah, though they
neither retained possession of it, nor disturbed the
shrines, nor threw down the "calf" of the new worship.
Jeroboam could not have created the "calf-worship"
if he had not found everything prepared for its acceptance.
Dan had been, since the earliest days, the seat
of a chapelry and ephod served by the lineal descendants
of Moses in unbroken succession; Bethel was
associated with some of the nation's holiest memories
since the days of their forefather Israel.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>
<p>2. Again, if in Jeroboam's day the Priestly Code
was in existence, he was clearly guilty of unjustifiable
wilfulness in altering the time for observing the Feast
of Tabernacles from the seventh to the eighth month.
But if there be little or no contemporary trace of any
observation of the Feast of Tabernacles&mdash;if, as
Nehemiah tells us, it had not once been <i>properly</i>
observed from the days of Joshua to his own, or if
Jeroboam was unaware of any sacred legislation on
the subject&mdash;the writers of the tenth century may have
judged too severely the fixing of a date for the Feast
of Ingathering, which may have seemed more suitable
to the conditions of the northern and western tribes.
For in parts of that region the harvest ripens a month
earlier than in Judah, and the festival was meant to
be kept at the season of harvest.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

<p>3. These, however, were but incidental and subordinate
matters compared with the setting up of the
golden calves.</p>

<p>Jeroboam felt that if his people flocked to do sacrifice
at the new and gorgeous Temple in Jerusalem they
would return to their old monarchy and put him to
death. He wished to avoid the fate of Ishbosheth.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>
He believed that he should be doing both a popular
and a politic act if he saved them from the burden of
this long journey and again decentralised the cult
which Solomon had so recently centralised. He determined,
therefore, to furnish the Ten Tribes with
high places, and temples of high places, and objects
of worship which might rival the golden cherubim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
of Zion, and be honoured with festal music and royal
pomp.</p>

<p>He never dreamed either of apostatising from Jehovah,
or of establishing the worship of idols. He broke the
Second Commandment under pretence of helping the
people to keep the first. The images which he set up
were not meant to be <i>substitutes</i> for the one God, the
God of their fathers, the God who had brought them
from the land of Egypt; they were regarded as figures
of Jehovah under the well understood and universally
adopted emblem of a young bull, the symbol of fertility
and strength.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Some have fancied that he was influenced
by his Egyptian reminiscences, and perhaps by Ano, his
traditional Egyptian bride. That is an obvious error.
In Egypt <i>living</i> bulls were worshipped under the
names of Apis and Mnevis, not idol-figures. Egyptian
gods would have been strange reminders of Him who
delivered His people from Egyptian tyranny. It would
have been insensate, by quoting the very words of
Aaron, to recall to the minds of the people the disasters
which had followed the worship of the golden calf in
the wilderness.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> Beyond all question, Jeroboam neither
did nor would have dreamed of bidding his whole people
to abandon their faith and worship Egyptian idols,
which never found any favour among the Israelites.
He only encouraged them to worship Jehovah under
the form of the cherubim.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> Whatever may have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
the aspect of the cherubim in the Oracle of the Temple,
cherubic emblems appeared profusely amid its ornamentation,
and the most conspicuous object in its courts
was the molten sea, supported on the backs of twelve
bulls. It is true that later prophets and poets, like
Hosea and the Psalmist, spoke in scorn of his images
as mere "calves," and spoke of him as likening his
Maker to "an ox that eateth hay."<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> They even came
in due time to regard them as figures of Baal and
Astarte,<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> but this view is falsified by the entire annals
of the Northern Kingdom from its commencement to
its close. Jeroboam was, and always regarded himself
as, a worshipper of Jehovah. He named his son and
destined successor Abijah ("Jehovah is my Father").
Rehoboam himself was a far worse offender than he
was, so far as the sanction of idolatry was concerned.</p>

<p>And yet he sinned, and yet he made Israel to sin.
It is true that he did not sin against the full extent
of the light and knowledge vouchsafed to men in later
days. The sin of which he was guilty was the sin of
worldly policy. With professions of religion on his
lips he pandered to the rude and sensuous instinct
which makes materialism in worship so much more
attractive to all weak minds than spirituality. Proclaiming
as his motive the rights of the people, he
accelerated their religious degeneracy. "The means
to strengthen or ruin the civil power," says Lowth,
"is either to establish or destroy the right worship of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
God. The way to destroy religion is to embase the
dispenser of it.... This is to give the royal stamp
to a piece of lead." If we may trust to Jewish tradition,
there were some families in Israel who, though they
clung to their old homes, and would not migrate to
the south, yet refused to worship what is, not quite
justly, called "the heifer Baal."<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> The legendary Tobit
(i. 4-7) boasts that "when all the tribes of Naphthali
fell from the house of Jerusalem and sacrificed to the
heifer Baal I alone went often to Jerusalem at the
feasts," and, in general, observed the provisions of the
Levitic law.</p>

<p>There seems to have been but little religion in
Jeroboam's temperament. In every other great national
gathering at Shechem and other sacred places we
read of religious rites.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> No mention is made of them,
no allusion occurs respecting them, in the assembly
to which Jeroboam owed his throne. He might at
least have consulted Ahijah, who had given him, when
he was still a subject, the Divine promise and sanction
of royalty. He might, had he chosen, have followed
a higher and purer guidance than that of his own
personal misgiving and his own arbitrary will. The
error which he committed was this&mdash;he trusted in
policy, not in the Living God. "It was," says Dean
Stanley, "precisely the policy of Abder-Rahman, Caliph
of Spain, when he arrested the movement of his subjects
to Mecca, by the erection of a Holy Place of the
Zeca at Cordova, and of Abd-el-Malik when he built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
the Dome of the Rock at Jerusalem, because of his
quarrel with the authorities at Mecca." He was not
guilty of revolt, for he acted under prophetic sanction;
nor of idolatry, for he did not abandon the worship
of Jehovah; but "he broke the unity and tampered
with the spiritual conception of the national worship.
From worshipping God under a gross material symbol,
the Israelites gradually learnt to worship other gods
altogether; and the venerable sanctuaries of Dan and
Bethel prepared the way for the temples of Ashtaroth
and Bethel at Samaria and Jezreel. The religion of
the kingdom of Israel at last sank lower than that
of the kingdom of Judah against which it had revolted.
'The sin of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
Israel to sin,' is the sin again and again repeated
in the policy, half-worldly, half-religious, which has
prevailed through large tracts of ecclesiastical history.
Many are the forms of worship which, with high
pretensions, have been nothing else but so many
various and opposite ways of breaking the Second
Commandment. Many a time has the end been held
to justify the means, and the Divine character been
degraded by the pretence, or even the sincere intention,
of upholding His cause, for the sake of secular
aggrandisement; for the sake of binding together good
systems, which it was feared would otherwise fall to
pieces; for the sake of supporting the faith of the
multitude for fear they should otherwise fall away to
rival sects, or lest the enemy should come and take
away their place and nation. False arguments have
been used in support of religious truths, false miracles
promulgated or tolerated, false readings in the sacred
text defended.... And so the faith of mankind has
been undermined by the very means intended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
preserve it. The whole subsequent history is a record
of the mode by which, with the best intentions,
Church and nation may be corrupted."</p>

<p>This view of Dean Stanley is confirmed by another
wise teacher, Professor F. D. Maurice. Jeroboam, he
says, "did not trust the Living God. He thought, not
that his kingdom stood upon a Divine <i>foundation</i>, but
that it was to be upheld by certain Divine props and
<i>sanctions</i>. The two doctrines seem closely akin. Many
regard them as identical. In truth there is a whole
heaven between them. The king who believes that
his kingdom has a Divine foundation confesses his own
subjection and responsibility to an actual living ruler.
The king who desires to surround himself with Divine
sanctions would fain make himself supreme, knows that
he cannot, and would therefore seek help from the fear
men have of an invisible power in which they have
ceased to believe. He wants a God as the support of
his authority. <i>What</i> God he cares very little."</p>

<p>And thus, to quote once more, "the departure from
spiritual principles out of political motives surely leads
to destruction, and is here portrayed for all times."<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p>We are told that Jeroboam, whose position probably
made him restless and insecure, first
built or fortified Shechem, and then went across the
Jordan and established another palace and stronghold
at Penuel. After this he shifted his residence once
more to the beautiful town of Tirzah,<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> where he built
for himself the palace which Zimri afterwards burnt
over his own head. Although the prophet Shemaiah
forbade Rehoboam's attempt to crush him in a great
war, Jeroboam remained at war with him and Abijah all
his life, till his reign of two-and-twenty troubled years
ended apparently by a sudden death&mdash;for the chronicler
says that "the Lord struck him, and he died."</p>

<p>Nearly all that we know of Jeroboam apart from
these incidental notices is made up of two stories, both
of which are believed by critics to date from a long
subsequent age, but which the compiler of the Book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
of Kings introduced into his narrative from their intrinsic
force and religious instructiveness.</p>

<p>The first of these stores tells us of the only spontaneous
prophetic protest against his proceedings of which
we read. So ancient is this curious narrative that
tradition had entirely forgotten the names of the two
prophets concerned in it. It probably assumed shape
from the dim local reminiscences evoked in the days
of Josiah's reformation, when the grave of a forgotten
prophet of Judah was discovered among the tombs at
Bethel, three hundred and twenty years after the events
described.</p>

<p>A nameless man of God&mdash;Josephus calls him Jadon,
and some have identified him with Iddo<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>&mdash;came out of
Judah to atone for the silence of Israel, and to protest
in God's name against the new worship. His protest,
however, is against "the altar." He does not say a
word about the golden calves. Jeroboam, perhaps, at
his dedication festival of the king's shrine at Bethel,
was standing on the altar-slope,<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> as Solomon had done
in the Temple, to burn incense. Suddenly the man of
God appeared, and threatened to the altar the destruction
and desecration which subsequently fell upon it.
We cannot be sure that some of the details are not
later additions supplied from subsequent events.
Josephus rationalises the story very absurdly in the
style of Paulus. The sign of the destruction or rending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
of the altar, and the outpouring of the ashes,<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> may have
been first fulfilled in that memorable earthquake which
became a date in Israel.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> The desecration which it
received at the hands of Josiah reminded men of the
threat of the unknown messenger.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> Then we are told
that Jeroboam raised his hand in anger, with the order
to secure the bold offender, but that his arm at once
"dried up," and was only restored by the man of God<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>
at the king's entreaty. The king invites the prophet
to go home and refresh himself and receive a reward;
but he replies that not half Jeroboam's house could
tempt him to break the command which he had received
to eat no bread neither drink water at Bethel. An old
Israelite prophet was living at Bethel, and his son told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
him what had occurred. Struck with admiration by
the faithfulness of the southern man of God, he rode
after him to bring him to his house. He found him
seated under "the terebinth"&mdash;evidently some aged and
famous tree. When he refused the renewed invitation,
the old man lyingly said to him that he too was a man
of God, and had been bidden by an angel to bring him
back. Deceived, perhaps too easily deceived, the man
of God from Judah went back. It would have been
well for him if he had believed that even "an angel of
God," or what may seem to wear such a semblance,
may preach a false message, and may deserve nothing
but an anathema.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> With terrible swiftness the delusion
was dispelled. While he was eating in Bethel, the
old prophet, overcome by an impulse of inspiration,
told him that for his disobedience he should perish and
lie in a strange grave. Accordingly he had not gone
far from Bethel when a lion met and killed him, not,
however, mangling or devouring him, but standing still
with the ass beside the carcase.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> On hearing this the
old prophet of Bethel went and brought back the
corpse. He mourned over his victim with the cry,
"Alas, my brother,"<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> and bade his sons that when he
died they should bury him in the same sepulchre with
the man of God, for all that he had prophesied should
come to pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>Josephus adds many idle touches to this story. If in
a tale which assumed its present form so long after
the events imaginative details were introduced, the
incident of the lion subserves the moral aim of the
narrative (2 Kings xvii. 25; Jer. xxv. 30, xlix. 19;
Wisdom xi. 15-17, etc.). The significance of the story
for us is happily neither historic nor evidential, but it
is profoundly moral. It is the lesson not to linger in
the neighbourhood of temptation, nor to be dilatory in
the completion of duty.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> It is the lesson to be ever on
our guard against the tendency to assume inspired
sanction for the conduct and opinions which coincide
with our own secret wishes. Satan finds it easy to
secure our credence when he answers us according to
our idols, and can quote Scripture for our purpose as
well as his own; and God sometimes punishes men by
granting them their own desires, and sending leanness
withal into their bones. The man of God from Judah
had received a distinct injunction from which the invitation
of a king had been insufficient to shake him. If
the old prophet wilfully lied, his victim was willingly
seduced. We may think his sin venial, his punishment
excessive. It will not seem so unless we unduly
extenuate his sin and unduly exaggerate the nature of
his penalty.</p>

<p>His sin consisted in his ready acceptance of a sham
inspiration which came to him from a tainted source,
and which he ought to have suspected because it conceded
what he desired. God's indisputable intimations
to our individual souls are not to be set aside except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
by intimations no less indisputable. There had been
an obvious reason for the command which God had
given. The reason still existed; the prohibition had
not been withdrawn. The sham revelation furnished
him with an excuse; it did not give him a justification.
Doubtless Jadon's first thought was that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He lied in every word,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That hoary prophet, with malicious eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Askance to watch the working of his lie."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Why did he yield so readily? It was for the same
reason which causes so many to sin. "The tempting
opportunity" did but meet, as sooner or later it always
<i>will</i> meet, "the susceptible disposition."</p>

<p>Yet his punishment does not justify us in branding
him as a weak or a vicious man. We must judge him
and all men, at his best, not at his worst; in his hours
of faithfulness and splendid courage, not in his moment
of unworthy acquiescence.</p>

<p>And his speedy punishment was his best blessing.
Who knows what might not have happened to him if
the speck of conventionality and corruption had been
allowed to spread? Who can tell whether in due time he
might not have sunk into something no better than his
miserable tempter? Rather than that we should be in
any respect false to our loftiest ideals, or less noble
than our better selves, let the lion meet us, let the
tower of Siloam fall on us, let our blood be mingled
with our sacrifices. Better physical death than spiritual
degeneracy.</p>

<p>The other story about Jeroboam is full of pathos;
and though here, too, there are obvious signs
that, in its present form, it could hardly have come from
a contemporary source, it doubtless records an historic
tradition. It is missing in the Septuagint, though
in some copies the blank is supplied from Aquila's
version.</p>

<p>Jeroboam was living with his queen at Tirzah when,
as a judgment on him for his neglect of the Divine
warning, his eldest and much loved son, Abijah, fell
sick. Torn with anxiety the king asked his wife to
disguise herself that she might not be recognised on
her journey, and to go to Shiloh, where Ahijah the
prophet lived,<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> to inquire about the dear youth's fate.
"Take with you," he said, "as a present to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
prophet ten loaves, and some little cakes for the
prophet's children,<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> and a cruse of honey."</p>

<p>Jeroboam remembered that Ahijah's former prophecy
had been fulfilled, and believed that he would again be
able to reveal the future, and say whether the heir to
the throne would recover. The queen obeyed; and if
she were indeed the Egyptian princess Ano, it must
have been for her a strange experience. Through the
winding valley, she reached the home of the aged
prophet unrecognised. But he had received a Divine
intimation of her errand; and though his eyes were
now blind with the <i>gutta serena</i>,<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> he at once addressed
her by name when he heard the sound of her approaching
footsteps. The message which he was bidden to
pronounce was utterly terrible; it was unrelieved by
a single gleam of mitigation or a single expression
of pity. It reproached and denounced Jeroboam for
faithless ingratitude in that he had cast God behind
his back;<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> it threatened hopeless and shameful extermination
to all his house.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> His dynasty should be
swept away like dung. The corpses of his children
should be left unburied and be devoured by vultures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
and wild dogs.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> The moment the feet of the queen
reached her house the youth should die, and this
bereavement, heavy as it was, should be the sole act of
mercy in the tragedy, for it should take away Abijah
from the dreadful days to come, because in him alone
of the House of Jeroboam had God seen something
good. The avenger should be a new king, and all this
should come to pass "even now."<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<p>This speech of the prophet is given in a rhythmical
form, and has probably been mingled with later touches.
It falls into two strophes (7-11, 12-16) of 3 + 2
and 2 + 3 verses.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> The expressions "thou hast done
above <i>all that were before thee</i>, for thou hast gone and
made thee <i>other gods</i>" (verse 9) hardly suits the case
of Jeroboam; and the omission by the LXX. of the
prophecy of Israel's ultimate captivity, together with
the treatment of the prophecy by Josephus, throw some
doubt on verses 9, 15, and 16.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> They seem to charge
Jeroboam with sanctioning <i>Asherim</i>, or wooden images
of the Nature-goddess Asherah, of which we read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
in the history of Judah, but which are never mentioned
in the acts of Jeroboam, and do not accord with his
avowed policy. These may possibly be due to the
forms which the tradition assumed in later days.</p>

<p>The awful prophecy was fulfilled. As the hapless
mother set foot on the threshold of her palace at
beautiful Tirzah the young prince died, and she heard
the wail of the mourners for him.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> He alone was
buried in the grave of his fathers, and Israel mourned
for him. He was evidently a prince of much hope
and promise, and the deaths of such princes have
always peculiarly affected the sympathy of nations.
We know in Roman history the sigh which arose at
the early death of Marcellus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ostendent terris hunc tantum fata neque ultra<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Esse sinent. Nimium vobis, Romana propago,<br /></span>

<p>We know the remark of Tacitus as he contemplates
the deaths of Germanicus, Caius, and Drusus, Piso
Licinianus, Britannicus, and Titus, "<i>breves atque
infaustos Populi Romani amores</i>." We know how,
when Prince William was drowned in the <i>White Ship</i>,
Henry of England never smiled again; and how the
nation mourned the deaths of Prince Alfonso, of the
Black Prince, of Prince Arthur, of Prince Henry, of
the Princess Charlotte, of the Duke of Clarence and
Avondale. But these untimely deaths of youths in
their early bloom, before their day,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>are not half so deplorable as the case of those who
have grown up like Nero to blight every hope which
has been formed of them. When Louis le <i>Bien-Aimé</i>
lay ill of the fever at Metz which seemed likely to be
fatal, all France wept and prayed for him. He recovered,
and grew up to be that portent of selfish
boredom and callous sensuality, Louis XV. It was
better that Abijah should die than that he should live
to be overwhelmed in the shameful ruin which soon
overtook his house. It was better far that he should
die than that he should grow up to frustrate the
promise of his youth. He was beckoned by the hand
of God "because in him was found some good thing
towards the Lord God of Israel." We are not told
wherein the goodness consisted, but Rabbinic tradition
guessed that in opposition to his father he discountenanced
the calf-worship and encouraged and helped
the people to continue their visits to Jerusalem. Such
a king might indeed have recovered the whole kingdom,
and have dispossessed David's degenerate line. But it
was not to be. The fiat against Israel had gone forth,
though a long space was to intervene before it was
fulfilled. And God's fiats are irrevocable, because with
Him there is no changeableness neither shadow of
turning.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The moving finger writes, and, having writ,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Moves on; nor all thy piety nor wit<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Nor all thy tears wash out a word of it."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the passage about Abijah has a unique preciousness,
because it stands alone in Scripture as an
expression of the truth that early death is no sign at
all of the Divine anger, and that the length or brevity
of life are matters of little significance to God, seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
that, at the best, the longest life is but as one tick of
the clock in the eternal silence. The promise to filial
obedience, "that thy days may be long," in the Fifth
Commandment is primarily national; and although
undoubtedly "length of days" then, as now, was regarded
as a blessing,<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> yet the blessing is purely relative,
and wholly incommensurate with others which affect
the character and the life to come. This passage may
be the consolation of many thousands of hearts that
ache for some dear lost child. "Is it well with the
child?" "It is well!" The story of Cleobis and
Biton shows how fully the wisest of the ancients had
recognised the truth that early death may be a boon
of God to save His children from being snared in
the evil days. "Honourable age," says the Book of
Wisdom, "is not that which standeth in length of
time, nor that is measured by number of years. But
wisdom is the grey hair unto men, and an unspotted
life is old age. He pleased God, and was beloved of
Him: so that living among sinners he was translated.
Yea, speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness
should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his
soul.... He, being made perfect in a short time,
fulfilled a long time: for his soul pleased the Lord:
therefore He hastens to take him away from among
the wicked."<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> It is the truth so beautifully expressed

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>

<h3><i>NADAB; BAASHA; ELAH.</i></h3>

<p class="center">1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> xv. 25-xvi. 10.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Wheresoever the carcase is, there will the vultures be gathered
together."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Matt.</span> xxiv. 28.</p></blockquote>


<p>Jeroboam slept with his fathers and went to his
own place, leaving behind him his dreadful epitaph
upon the sacred page. His son Nadab succeeded
him. In his reign of twenty-two years the first king
of Israel had outlived Rehoboam and his son Abijah.
Asa, the great grandson of Solomon, was already on
the throne of Judah. Of Nadab we are told next to
nothing. The appreciation of the kings of Israel tends
to drift into the meagre formula that they did that
which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked
in the way of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and in his
sin wherewith he caused Israel to sin. In the second
year of his reign Nadab was engaged in a wearisome
military expedition against Gibbethon in the Shephelah,
which belonged to the Philistines. It was a Levitical
city in the tribe of Dan, which had been assigned to
the Kohathites, and its siege continued for twenty-seven
years with no apparent result.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> That the Philistines,
who had been so utterly crushed by David and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
who were an insignificant power, should have thus
been able to assert themselves once more, is a proof
of the weakness to which Israel had been reduced.
While Nadab was thus occupied, an obscure conspirator,
Baasha, son of Ahijah, of the tribe of Issachar,<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>
actuated perhaps by tribal jealousy, or stirred up as
Jeroboam had been before him and as Jehu was after
him by some prophetic message, conspired against him,
and slew him.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> As soon as this military revolt had
placed Baasha on the throne he fulfilled the frightful
curse which Ahijah had uttered against the House of
Jeroboam. He absolutely exterminated the family of
Nebat, and left him neither kinsman nor friend to
avenge his death. He seems to have been a powerful
soldier, and he inflicted severe humiliation on the
Southern Kingdom until Asa bribed Benhadad to invade
his territory. He reigned at Tirzah for twenty-four
years, of which nothing is recorded but the ordinary
formula. Towards the close of his reign he received
from the prophet Jehu, the son of Hanani, the message
of his doom. Jehu must have been at this time a young
prophet. According to the Chronicles his father Hanani
rebuked Asa for the alliance which (as we shall see)
he made with the Syrian against Baasha;<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> and he himself
rebuked Jehoshaphat for his alliance with Ahab,
and lived to be his annalist.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> Like Amos, he lived in
Judah, but prophesied also against a king of Israel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
He told Baasha that God, who had exalted him out
of the dust to be king of Israel, should inflict on his
family the same terrible extirpation which He had
inflicted on the House of Jeroboam, whose sins he
had, nevertheless, followed.</p>

<p>Baasha "slept with his fathers," and his son Elah
succeeded him. Elah seems to have been an incapable
drunkard, and reigned in Tirzah for less than two
years. While he was drinking himself drunk, not
even secretly in his own palace, but in the house of
his chamberlain Arza&mdash;a shamelessness which was
regarded as an aggravation of his offence<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>&mdash;he was
murdered by Zimri, the captain of half of his chariots,
and the revolting tragedy of massacre was enacted once
again.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> The fact that Baasha was a man of no distinction,
but "exalted <i>out of the dust</i>" (1 Kings xvi. 2),
probably added to the weakness of his dynasty.</p>

<p>From such meagre records of horror there is not
much to learn beyond the general truth of the Nemesis
which dogs the heels of crime; but there is one significant
clause which throws great light on the judgment
which we are asked to form of these events. The
prophet Jehu rebukes Baasha for showing himself false
to the destiny to which God had summoned him. He
implies, therefore, that Baasha had some Divine sanction
for the revolution which he headed; and certainly in
his slaughter of the House of Jeroboam he was the
instrument of a Divine decree. Yet we are expressly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
told that "he provoked the Lord to anger with the
work of his hands, in being like the House of Jeroboam,
<i>and because he killed him</i>," or, as it is rendered in the
Revised Version margin, "<i>because he smote it</i>." This is
not the only place where we find that a man may be in
<i>one sense</i> commissioned to do a deed of blood, yet in
another sense may be held guilty for fulfilment of the
commission.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> The prophecy of extirpation had been
passed, but the cruel agent of its accomplishment was
not thereby condoned. God's decrees are carried out
as part of the vast scheme of Providence, and He may
use guilty hands to fulfil His purposes. King Jehu is
His minister of vengeance, but the tiger-like ferocity
with which he carried out his work awoke God's anger
and received God's punishment. The King of Babylon
fulfils the purpose for which he had been appointed,
but his ruthlessness receives its just recompense. The
wrath of man may accomplish the decrees of God, but
it worketh not His righteousness. Herod and Pontius
Pilate, Jews and Gentiles, priests and Pharisees, rulers
and the mob may rage against Christ, but all they can
accomplish is "whatsoever God's hand and God's
counsel determine before to be done."</p>

<h3><i>THE EARLIER KINGS OF JUDAH.</i></h3>

<p class="center">1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> xiv. 21-31, xv. 1-24.</p>


<p>The history of "<i>the Jews</i>" begins, properly
speaking, from the reign of Rehoboam, and for
four centuries it is mainly the history of the Davidic
dynasty.</p>

<p>The only records of the son of Solomon are meagre
records of disaster and disgrace. He reigned seventeen
years, and his mother, the Ammonitess Naamah,
occupied the position of queen-mother.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> She was,
doubtless, a worshipper in the shrine which Solomon
had built for her national god, Molech of Ammon, who
was the same as the Ashtar-Chemosh of the Moabite
stone&mdash;the male form of Ashtoreth.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> Whether her son
was twenty-one or forty-one when he succeeded to the
throne we do not know.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> His attempted expedition
against Jeroboam was forbidden by Shemaiah;<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
ineffectual and distressing war smouldered on between
the Northern and Southern Kingdoms. If Jeroboam
sinned by the erection in the old sanctuaries of the
two golden calves, Rehoboam surely sinned far more
heinously. He not only sanctioned the high places&mdash;which
in him may have been very venial, since they
held their own unchallenged till the days of Hezekiah&mdash;but
he allowed stone obelisks (<i>Matstseboth</i>) in honour
of Baal, and pillars (<i>Chammanim</i>) of the Nature-goddess
(<i>Asherah</i>) to be set up on every high hill and
under every green tree.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> Worse than this, and a proof
of the abyss of corruption into which the evil example
of Solomon had beguiled the nation, there were found
in the land the <i>Kedeshim</i>, the infamous eunuch-ministers
of a most foul worship.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> In spite of Temple and priesthood,
"they did according to all the abominations of
the nations which the Lord drave out before the
children of Israel."<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> Since Rehoboam thus sinned so
much more heinously than his northern compeer we
can hardly admire the conduct of the Levites, who,
according to the chronicler, fled southward in swarms
from the innovations of the son of Nebat. The Scylla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
of calf-worship was incomparably less shameful than
the Charybdis of these heathen abominations.</p>

<p>Such atrocities could not be left unpunished. Where
the carcase is the eagles will gather. In the fifth year
of Rehoboam, Shishak, King of Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> put an end to
the shortlived glories of the age of Solomon. Of his
reason for invading Palestine we know nothing. It
was probably mere ambition and the love of plunder,
stimulated by stories which Jeroboam may have brought
to him about the inexhaustible riches of Jerusalem.
He is the first Pharaoh whose individuality was so
marked as to transcend and replace the common
dynastic name.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> He was astute enough to seize the
opportunity of self-aggrandisement which offered itself
when Jeroboam took refuge at his court; but the conjecture
that former friendly relations induced Jeroboam
to invite the services of Shishak for the destruction
of his rival, is rendered impossible if Egyptologists
have correctly deciphered the splendid memorial of
his achievements which he twice carved on the great
Temple of Amon at Karnak. There the most conspicuous
figure is the colossal likeness of the king.
His right hand holds a sword;<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> his left grasps by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
hair a long line which passes round the necks of a
troop of thirty-eight mean and diminutive Jewish
captives. The smaller figure of the god Amon leads
other strings of one hundred and thirty-three captives,
and the third king from his left hand bears a name
which Champollion deciphered <i>Yudeh-Malk</i>, which he
took to mean King of Judah.<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> If the interpretation
were correct, we should here have a picture of the son
of Solomon. On the other figures are the names of
the cities of which they were kings or sheykhs. Among
these are not only the names of southern towns, like
Ibleam, Gibeon, Bethhoron, Ajalon, Mahanaim, but
even of Canaanite and Levitic cities in the Northern
Kingdom, including Taanach and Megiddo.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> Shashonq
(as the monuments call him) came with a huge and
motley army of many nationalities, among whom were
Libyans, Troglodytes, and Ethiopians. This host was
composed of twelve hundred chariots, sixty thousand
horsemen, and a numberless infantry of mercenaries.
Such an invasion, though it was little more than an
insulting military parade and predatory incursion,
rendered resistance impossible, especially to a people
enervated by luxury. Shishak came, saw,&mdash;and
plundered. His chief spoil was taken from the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
dishonoured Temple and the king's palace.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> Judah
specially grieved for the loss of the shields of gold
which hung on the cedar pillars of the house of the
forest of Lebanon,<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>&mdash;apparently both those which
Solomon had made, and those which David had consecrated
from the spoils of Hadadezer, King of Zobah.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>
Perhaps a great soul would hardly have been consoled
by putting mean substitutes in their place. Rehoboam,
however, made bronze imitations of them in the guard-room,<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>
and marched in pomp to the Temple preceded
by his meanly armed runners,<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> "as though everything
was the same as before." "The bitter irony with
which the sacred historian records the parade of these
counterfeits," says Stanley, "may be considered as the
keynote to this whole period. They well represent
the 'brazen shields' by which fallen churches and
kingdoms have endeavoured to conceal from their own
and their neighbours' eyes that the golden shields of
Solomon have passed away from them."<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> The age of
pinchbeck follows the age of gold, and a Louis XV.
succeeds Le Grand Monarque.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p>Rehoboam had many sons, and he "wisely" (2 Chron.
xi. 23) gave them, by way of maintenance, the governorship
of his fenced cities. That "he sought for them a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
multitude of wives" was perhaps a stroke of worldly
policy, but an unwise and unworthy one. But their
little courts and their little harems may have helped
to keep them out of mischief. They might otherwise
have destroyed each other by mutual jealousies.</p>

<p>Rehoboam was succeeded by his son Abijam. There
is a little doubt as to the exact name of this king. The
Book of Chronicles calls him Abijah,<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> but in 1 Kings xv.
1, 7, 8, he is called Abijam.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> As the curious form Abijam
seems to be unmeaning, it has been precariously conjectured
that dislike to his idolatries led the Jews to alter
a name which means "Jehovah is my Father."<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> Some
doubt also rests on the name of his mother. She is
here called "Maacha, the daughter of Abishalom," but
in Chronicles "Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel of
Gibeah." Maachah was perhaps the <i>granddaughter</i> of
Absalom, whose beautiful daughter Tamar (named
after his dishonoured sister) may have been the wife of
Uriel. In that case her name, Maachah, was a name
given her in reminiscence of her royal descent as a
great-granddaughter of the princess of Geshur, who
was mother of Absalom. All sorts of secrets, however,
sometimes lie behind these changes of names. She
was the second, but favourite wife of Rehoboam; and
Abijam, who was not the eldest son, owed his throne
to his father's preference for her.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>All that we are here told of Abijam is that "his
heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God," and that
"he walked in all the sins of his father"; though "for
David's sake his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem";<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>
and that, after a brief reign of three years&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, of one
year and parts of two others&mdash;he slept with his fathers.
For "the rest of his acts and all that he did," the
historian refers us to the Chronicles of the Kings of
Judah: he does not trouble himself with military
details. The chronicler, referring to the Commentary
of Iddo,<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> adds a great deal more. Jeroboam, he says,
went out against him with eight hundred thousand men.
Abijam, who had only half the number, stood on Mount
Zemaraim in the hill country of Ephraim,<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> and made a
speech to Jeroboam and his army. He reproached him
with rebellion against his father when he was "young
and tender-hearted," and with his golden calves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
his non-Levitical priests. He vaunted the superiority
of the Temple priests with their holocausts and sweet
incense and shewbread and golden candlestick, which
priests were now with the army. Jeroboam sets an
ambuscade, but at the shout of the men of Judah is
routed with a loss of five hundred thousand men, after
which Abijah recovers "Bethel with the towns thereof,"<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>
and Jeshanah and Ephron (or "Ephraim"), completely
humbling the northern king until "the Lord smote him
and he died." After this Abijah waxes mighty, has
fourteen wives, twenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters.</p>

<p>If we had read two accounts so different, and presenting
such insuperable difficulties to the harmonist,
in secular historians, we should have made no attempt
to reconcile them, but merely have endeavoured to find
which record was the more trustworthy. If the pious
Levitical king of 2 Chron. xiii. be a true picture of the
idolater of 1 Kings xv. 3, it is clear that the accounts
are difficult to reconcile, unless we resort to incessant
and arbitrary hypotheses. But the earlier authority is
clearly to be preferred when the two obviously conflict
with each other. As it is we can only say that the
kings of whom the chronicler approves are, as it were,
clericalised, and seen "through a cloud of incense," all
their faults being omitted. The edifying speech of
Abijah, and his boast about purity of worship, sounds
most strange on the lips of a king who&mdash;if he "walked
in all the sins of his father"&mdash;suffered his people to
be guilty of a worship grossly idolatrous, including the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
toleration of <i>Bamoth</i>, <i>Chammanim</i>, and <i>Asherim</i> on every
high hill and under every green tree; and of all the
abominations of the neighbouring idolaters,<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>&mdash;a state
of things infinitely worse than the symbolic Jehovah-worship
which Jeroboam had set up. Yet such was
the strange syncretism of religion in Jerusalem, of
which Solomon had set the fatal example, that (as we
learn quite incidentally) Abijah seems to have dedicated
certain vessels&mdash;part of his warlike spoils&mdash;to the
service of the Temple.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> They were perhaps intended
to supply the gaps left by the plundering raid of
Shishak.</p>

<p>After this brief and perplexing, but apparently
eventful reign, Abijah was succeeded by his son Asa,
whose long reign of forty-one years was contemporary
with the reigns of no less than seven kings of Israel&mdash;Nadab,
Baasha, Elah, Zimri, Omri, Tibni, and Ahab.</p>

<p>We are told that&mdash;aided perhaps by such prophets
as Hanani and Azariah, son of Oded<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> (or Iddo)&mdash;"he
did that which was right in the sight of the Lord." Of
this he gave an early, decisive, and courageous proof.</p>

<p>When he succeeded to the throne at an early age
his grandmother Maachah still held the high position
of queen-mother.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> This great lady inherited the fame
and popularity of Absalom, and was a princess both
of the line of David and of Tolmai, King of Geshur.
She was, and always had been, an open idolatress.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>
Asa began his reign with a reformation. He took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
away the contemptible idols (<i>Gilloolim</i>) which his fathers
had made, and suppressed the odious <i>Kedeshim</i>; or he
at least made a serious, if an unsuccessful, effort to do
so.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> As to the high places we have a direct verbal
contradiction. Here we are told that "they were not
removed," whereas the chronicler says that "he took
them away out of all the cities of Judah," but afterwards
that "the high places were not taken away out
of Israel," in spite of Asa's heart being perfect all his
days. The explanation would seem to be that he made
a partial attempt to anticipate the subsequent reformation
of Hezekiah, but was defeated by the inveteracy
of popular custom. He did, however, take the great
step of branding with infamy the impure idolatry of the
queen-mother, and he degraded her from her rank.
She had made an idol, which is significantly called "a
fright" or "a horror" (<i>Miphletzeth</i>),<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> to serve as an
emblem of the Nature-goddess. It was probably a
phallic symbol which he indignantly cut down, and
burnt it, where all pollutions were destroyed, in the
dry wady of the Kidron.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> In the fifteenth year of his
reign he dedicated in the Temple "silver and gold and
vessels," consecrated by his father and himself for this
purpose. He also restored the great altar in the porch
of the Temple, which in the course of more than sixty
years had fallen into neglect and disrepair.</p>

<p>For ten years the land had rest under this pious
king, though war was always smouldering between him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
and Baasha. In the eleventh year, however, according
to the chronicler, "Zerach the Ethiopian"<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> attacked him
with an army of <i>a million</i> Sushim and Lubim and
three hundred chariots, and suffered an immense defeat
in the valley of Zephathah, "the watch-tower" at
Mareshah.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> It was the sole occasion in sacred history
in which an Israelite army met and defeated one of
the great world powers in open battle, and it was
deemed so remarkable a proof of Divine interposition
that Asa, encouraged by the prophet Azariah, invited
his people to renew their covenant with God.</p>

<p>More alarming to Asa was the action of Baasha in
fortifying Ramah<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> in the thirty-sixth year of Asa's
reign. This was a veritable &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#967;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#8056;&#962; of the most
dangerous kind, for Ramah, in the heart of Benjamin,
was only five miles north of Jerusalem. If Abijah's
signal defeat of Jeroboam and capture of Bethel,
Jeshanah, and Ephron be historical, these towns must
not only have been speedily recovered, but Baasha had
even pushed towards Jerusalem, five miles south of
Bethel. Had Ramah been left undisturbed it would
have been a thorn in the side of Judah, as Deceleia
was in Attica, and Pylos in Messenia. Asa saw that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
the demolition of this fortress was a positive necessity.
Since he was too weak to effect this, he stripped both
his own palace and the Temple of the treasures with
which he had himself enriched them, and sent them
as a vast bribe to Benhadad I., King of Damascus,
begging him to renew the treaty which had existed
between their fathers, and to invade the kingdom of
Baasha. This step shows to what a depth of weakness
Judah had fallen, for Benhadad was a son of Tabrimmon,
the son of Hezion (probably Rezon) of Damascus;<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>
so that here we have the great-grandson of Solomon
stripping Solomon's Temple of its consecrated vessels
wherewith to bribe the grandson of the petty rebel
freebooter, whose whole present kingdom had once
been a part of Solomon's dominions! The policy was
successful. It is easy for us now to condemn it as
unpatriotic and short-sighted, but to Asa it seemed
a matter of life or death. Benhadad invaded Israel,
and mastered its territory in the tribe of Naphtali, from
Ijon and Abel-beth-maachah on the waters of Merom<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>
down to Chinnereth or the Lake of Gennesareth.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>
Baasha in alarm abandoned his attempt to blockade
Jerusalem, and retired to Tirzah for the protection of
his own kingdom. Thereupon Asa proclaimed a levy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
of all Judah to seize and dismantle Ramah, and with
the ample materials which Baasha had amassed he
fortified Geba to the north of Ramah<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> and Mizpah
(probably Neby Samwyl, to the north of the Mount of
Olives), where he also sank a deep well for the use
of the garrison.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> He thus effectually protected the
frontier of Benjamin. He built, as Bossuet says, "the
fortresses of Judah out of the ruins of those of Samaria,"
and thus set us the example of making holy use of
hostile and heretical materials. We should have thought
that the invitation of Benhadad was, in a worldly point
of view, brilliantly successful, and that it saved the
kingdom of Judah from utter ruin. It involved, however,
a dangerous precedent, and Hanani rebuked Asa
for having done foolishly.</p>

<p>After a powerful and useful reign Asa was attacked
with gout in his feet two years before his death. The
chronicler reproaches him for seeking "not to Jehovah
but to the physicians" in his "exceeding great disease."
If this was a sin, it is one of which we are unable to
estimate the sinfulness from this meagre notice. It has
been conjectured that it may have some reference to the
name Asa, which, if written Asjah, might mean "whom
Jehovah heals."<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> It belongs, however, to the theocratic
standpoint of the chronicler, who condemns everything
which bears the aspect of a worldly policy. He slept
with his fathers in a tomb which he had built for himself,
and was buried with unusual magnificence, amid
the burning of many spices.</p>

<p>We are not surprised that the historian should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
mention the invasion of Zerah, since he refers us for the
wars f Asa to the Judæan annals. It is much more
remarkable that he wholly omits all reference to the
prophetic activity of which the chronicler speaks as
exercised in this reign. He had evidently formed a
very high estimate of Asa, with none of the shadows
and drawbacks which in the later annalist seemed to
point to a marked degeneracy of character in his later
days. On the favourable side the historian does not
mention the high and eulogistic encouragement which
the king received from Azariah, the son of Oded; nor
the multitude which joined him out of Israel; nor the
cities which he took from the hill country of Ephraim;
nor his restoration of the altar. He even passes over
the solemn league and covenant which he made with
Judah and Benjamin and many members of the Ten
Tribes in his fifteenth year, at a festival celebrated
with an immense sacrifice, and with shouting and
trumpets and cornets and a great exultant oath.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> On
the unfavourable side he does not tell us that Hanani
the Seer rebuked him for summoning the help of the
Syrians instead of relying on Jehovah; and that Asa
"was in a rage because of this thing, and shut up
Hanani in the House of the Stocks," and "oppressed
some of the people at the same time," apparently
because they took part with the prophet.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> For none
of these events does the chronicler refer us to any
ancient authority. They came from separate records,
perhaps written in prophetic commentaries and unknown
to the compiler of the Kings. But whatever may have
been the failings or shortcomings of Asa it is clear
that he must be ranked among the more eminent and
righteous sovereigns of Judah.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>

<h3><i>JEHOSHAPHAT.</i></h3>

<p class="center">1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> xxii. 41-50.</p>


<p>Before we leave the House of David we must
speak of Jehoshaphat, the last king of Judah
whose reign is narrated in the First Book of Kings.
He was abler, more powerful, and more faithful to
Jehovah than any of his predecessors, and was alone
counted worthy in later ages to rank with Hezekiah
and Josiah among the most pious rulers of the Davidic
line. The annals of his reign are found chiefly in the
Second Book of Chronicles, where his story occupies
four long chapters. The First Book of Kings compresses
all record of him into nine verses, except so
far as his fortunes are commingled with the history
of Ahab. But both accounts show us a reign which
contributed as greatly to the prosperity of Judah
as that of Jeroboam II. contributed to the prosperity
of Israel.</p>

<p>He ascended the throne at the age of thirty-five.
He was apparently the only son of Asa, by Azubah, the
daughter of Shilhi; for Asa, greatly to his credit, seems
to have been the first king of Judah who set his face
against the monstrous polygamy of his predecessors,
and, so far as we know, contented himself with a single
wife. He received the high eulogy that "he turned not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
aside from doing that which was right in the eyes of
the Lord," with the customary qualification that, nevertheless,
the people still burnt incense and offerings at
the <i>Bamoth</i>, which were not taken away. The chronicler
says that he <i>did</i> take them away. This stock contradiction
between the two authorities must be accounted
for either by a contrast between the effort and its
failure, or by a distinction between idolatrous <i>Bamoth</i>
and those dedicated to the worship of Jehovah to
which the people clung with the deep affection which
local sanctuaries inspire.</p>

<p>To the historians of the Book of Kings the central
fact of Jehoshaphat's history is that "he made peace
with the King of Israel." As a piece of ordinary
statesmanship no step could have been more praiseworthy.
The sixty-eight years or more which had
elapsed since the divinely-suggested choice of Jeroboam
by the Northern Kingdom had tended to soften old
exasperations. The kingdom of Israel was now an
established fact, and nothing had become more obvious
than that the past could not be undone. Meanwhile
the threatening spectre of Syria, under the dynasty of
Benhadad, was beginning to throw a dark shadow over
both kingdoms. It had become certain that, if they
continued to destroy each other by internecine warfare,
both would succumb to the foreign invader. Wisely,
therefore, and kindly Jehoshaphat determined to make
peace with Ahab, in about the eighth year after his
accession; and this policy he consistently maintained
to the close of his twenty-five years' reign.</p>

<p>No one surely could blame him for putting an end to
an exhaustive civil war between brethren. Indeed, in
so doing he was but carrying out the policy which had
been dictated to Rehoboam by the prophet Shemaiah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
when he forbade him to attempt the immense expedition
which he had prepared to annihilate Jeroboam. Peace
was necessary to the development and happiness of
both kingdoms, but even more so to the smaller and
weaker, threatened as it was not only by the more
distant menace of Syria, but by the might of Egypt
on the south and the dangerous predatory warfare of
Edom and Moab on the east.</p>

<p>But Jehoshaphat went further than this. He
cemented the new peace by an alliance between his
young son Jehoram and Athaliah, daughter of Ahab and
Jezebel, who was then perhaps under fifteen years of age.</p>

<p>Later chroniclers formed their moral estimates by a
standard which did not exist so many centuries before
the date at which they wrote. If we are to judge the
conduct of these kings truthfully we must take an unbiassed
view of their conduct. We adopt this principle
when we try to understand the characters of saints and
patriarchs like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, or judges and
prophets like Gideon, Deborah, and Samuel; and in
general we must not sweepingly condemn the holy men
of old because they lacked the full illumination of the
gospel. We must be guided by a spirit of fairness if we
desire to form a true conception of the kings who lived in
the ninth century before Christ. It is probable that the
religious gulf between the kings of Judah and Israel
was not so immense as on a superficial view it might
appear to be; indeed, the balance seems to be in favour
of Jeroboam as against Abijam, Rehoboam, or even
Solomon. The worship of the golden symbols at Dan
and Bethel did not appear half so heinous to the people
of Judah as it does to us. Even in the Temple they had
cherubim and oxen. The <i>Bamoth</i> to Chemosh, Milcom,
and Astarte glittered before them undisturbed on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
summit of Olivet, and abominations which they either
tolerated or could not remove sheltered themselves in
the very precincts of the Temple, under the shadows
of its desecrated trees. To the pious Jehoshaphat the
tolerance of Baal-worship by Ahab could hardly appear
more deadly than the tolerance of Chemosh-worship
by his great-great-grandfather, and the permission of
<i>Asherim</i> and <i>Chammanim</i> by his grandfather, to say
nothing of the phallic horror openly patronised by the
queen-mother who was a granddaughter of David.
That Ahab himself was a worshipper of Jehovah is
sufficiently proved by the fact that he had given the
name of Athaliah to the young princess whose hand
Jehoshaphat sought for his son, and the name of
Ahaziah ("Jehovah taketh hold") to the prince who
was to be his heir. Jehoshaphat acted from policy; but
so has every king done who has ever reigned. He could
neither be expected to see these things with the illumination
of a prophet, nor to read&mdash;as later writers
could do in the light of history&mdash;the awful issues
involved in an alliance which looked to him so necessary
and so advantageous.</p>

<p>At the time of the proposed alliance there seems
to have been no protest&mdash;at any rate, none of which
we read. Micaiah alone among the prophets uttered
his stern warning when the expedition to Ramoth
Gilead was actually on foot, and Jehu, son of Hanani,
went out to rebuke Jehoshaphat at the close of that
disastrous enterprise. It is to the history attributed to
this seer and embodied in the annals of Israel that the
chronicler refers. "Shouldst thou help the wicked,"
asked the bold prophet, "and love them that hate the
Lord? For this thing wrath is upon thee from the
Lord. Nevertheless, there are good things found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
thee, in that thou hast put away the Asheroth out of
the land, and hast set thy heart to seek God."</p>

<p>The moral principle which Jehu, son of Hanani, here
enunciated is profoundly true. It was terribly emphasised
by the subsequent events. A just and wise
forecast may have sanctioned the restoration of peace,
but Jehoshaphat might at least have learnt enough
to avoid affinity with a queen who, like Jezebel, had
introduced frightful and tyrannous iniquities into the
House of Ahab. Faithful as the King of Judah evidently
intended to be to the law of Jehovah, he should have
hesitated before forming such close bonds of connexion
with the cruel daughter of the usurping Tyrian priest.
His error hardly diminished the warmth of that glowing
eulogy which even the chronicler pronounces upon
him; but it brought upon his kingdom, and upon the
whole family of his grandchildren, overwhelming misery
and all but total extermination. The rules of God's
moral government are written large on the story of
nations, and the consequences of our actions come
upon us not arbitrarily, but in accordance with universal
laws. When we err, even though our error be leniently
judged and fully pardoned, the human consequences of
the deeds which we have done may still come flowing
over us with the resistless march of the ocean tides.</p>

<span class="i1">We sin: God's intimations rather fail<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In clearness than in energy."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Jehoshaphat did not live to see the ultimate issues of
massacre and despotism which came in the train of his
son Jehoram's marriage.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> Perhaps to him it wore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
golden aspect which it wears in the forty-fifth Psalm,
which, as some have imagined, was composed on this
occasion. But he had abundant proof that close
relationship for mutual offence and defence with the
kings of Israel brought no blessing in its train. In
the expedition against Ramoth Gilead when Ahab was
slain, he too very nearly lost his life. Even this did
not disturb his alliance with Ahab's son Ahaziah, with
whom he joined in a maritime enterprise which, like its
predecessors, turned out to be a total failure.</p>

<p>Jehoshaphat in his successful wars had established
the supremacy over Edom which had been all but lost
in the days of Solomon. The Edomite Hadad and his
successors had not been able to hold their own, and
the present kings of Edom were deputies or vassals
under the suzerainty of Judæa.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> This once more
opened the path to Elath and Ezion-Geber on the gulf
of Akaba. Jehoshaphat, in his prosperity, felt a desire
to revive the old costly commerce of Solomon with
Ophir for gold, sandal wood, and curious animals. For
this purpose he built "ships of Tarshish," <i>i.e.</i>, merchant
ships, like those used for the Ph&#339;nician trade between
Tyre and Tartessus, to go this long voyage. The
ships, however, were wrecked on the reefs of Ezion-Geber,
for the Jews were timid and inexperienced
mariners. Hearing of this disaster, according to the
Book of Kings, Ahaziah made an offer to Jehoshaphat
to make the enterprise a joint one,&mdash;thinking, apparently,
that the Israelites, who, perhaps, held Joppa and
some of the ports on the coast, would bring more skill
and knowledge to bear on the result. But Jehoshaphat
had had enough of an attempt which was so dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
and which offered no solid advantages. He declined
Ahaziah's offer. The story of these circumstances in
the chronicler is different. He speaks as if from the
first it was a joint experiment of the two kings, and
says that, after the wreck of the fleet, a prophet of
whom we know nothing, "Eliezer, the son of Dodavahu
of Mareshah,"<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying,
"Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah,
Jehovah hath made a breach in thy works." The
passage shows that the word "prophesied" was constantly
used in the sense of "preached," and did not
necessarily imply any prediction of events yet future.
The chronicler, however, apparently makes the mistake
of supposing that ships were built at Ezion-Geber on
the Red Sea to sail to Tartessus in Spain!<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> The
earlier and better authority says correctly that these
merchantmen were built to trade with Ophir, in India,
or Arabia. The chronicler seems to have been unaware
that "ships of Tarshish," like our "Indiamen,"
was a general title for vessels of a special build.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p>We see enough in the Book of Kings to show the
greatness and goodness of Jehoshaphat, and later on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
we shall hear details of his military expeditions.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> The
chronicler, glorifying him still more, says that he sent
princes and Levites and priests to teach the Book of
the Law throughout all the cities of Judah; that he
received large presents and tribute from neighbouring
peoples; that he built castles and stone cities; and
that he had a stupendous army of 160,000 troops under
four great generals. He also narrates that when an
immense host of Moabites, Ammonites, and Meunim
came against him to Hazezon-Tamar or Engedi, he took
his stand before the people in the Temple in front of
the new court and prayed. Thereupon the Spirit of the
Lord came upon "Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son
of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah the
Levite, of the sons of Asaph," who told them that the
next day they should go against the invader, but that
they need not strike a blow. The battle was God's, not
theirs. All they had to do was to stand still and see
the salvation of Jehovah. On hearing this the king and
all his people prostrated themselves, and the Levites
stood up to praise God. Next morning Jehoshaphat
told his people to believe God and His prophets and
they should prosper, and bade them chant the verse,
"Give thanks unto the Lord, for His mercy endureth
for ever," which now forms the refrain of Psalm
cxxxvi.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> On this Jehovah "set liers in wait against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir."
Intestine struggles arose among the invaders. The
inhabitants of Mount Seir were first destroyed, and the
rest then turned their swords against each other until
they were all "dead bodies fallen to the earth." The
soldiers of Jehoshaphat despoiled these corpses for
three days, and on the fourth assembled themselves in
the valley of Beracah ("Blessing"), which received its
name from their tumultuous rejoicings.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> After this
they returned to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps
and trumpets, and God gave Jehoshaphat rest from all
his enemies round about. Of all this the historian of
the Kings tells us nothing. Jehoshaphat died full of
years and honours, leaving seven sons, of whom the
eldest was Jehoram.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> His reign marks a decisive
triumph of the prophetic party. The prophets not
only felt a fiercely just abhorrence of the abominations
of Canaanite idolatry, but wished to establish a theocracy
to the exclusion on the one hand of all local and
symbolic worship, and on the other of all reliance on
worldly policy. Up to this time, as Dean Stanley says
in his usual strikingly picturesque manner, "if there
was a 'holy city,' there was also an 'unholy city' within
the walls of Sion. It was like a seething caldron of
blood and froth 'whose scum is therein and whose
scum has not gone out of it.' The Temple was hemmed
in by dark idolatries on every side. Mount Olivet was
covered with heathen sanctuaries, monumental stones,
and pillars of Baal. Wooden images of Astarte under
the sacred trees, huge images of Molech appeared at
every turn in the walks around Jerusalem."<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> Jehoshaphat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
introduced a decisive improvement into the conditions
which prevailed under Rehoboam and Abijah, but
practically the conflict between light and darkness goes
on for ever. It was in days when Jerusalem had come
to be regarded by herself and by all nations as exceptionally
holy, that she, who had been for centuries the
murderess of the prophets, became under her priestly
religionists the murderess of the Christ, and&mdash;far
different in God's eyes from what she was in her own&mdash;deserved
the dreadful stigma of being "the great
city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt."</p>

<h3><i>THE KINGS OF ISRAEL FROM ZIMRI TO AHAB.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 889-877.</p>

<p class="center">1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> xvi. 11-34.</p>


<p>As far as we can understand from our meagre
authorities&mdash;and we have no independent source
of information&mdash;we infer that Elah, son of the powerful
Baasha, was a self-indulgent weakling. The army of
Israel was encamped against Gibbethon&mdash;originally
a Levitical town of the Kohathites, in the territory of
Dan&mdash;which they hoped to wrest from the Philistines.
It was during the interminable and intermittent siege
of this town that Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, had been
murdered. Whatever may have been his sins, he was
in his proper place leading the armies of Israel. Elah
was not there, but in his beautiful palace at Tirzah.
It was probably contempt for his incapacity and the
bad example of Baasha's successful revolt, that tempted
Zimri to murder him as he was drinking himself drunk
in the house of his chamberlain Arza. Zimri was a
commander of half the chariots, and probably thinking
that he could secure the throne by a <i>coup de main</i>
he slew not only Elah, but every male member of his
family. To extinguish any possibility of vengeance,
he even massacred all who were known to be friends
of the royal house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a consummate crime, and it was followed by
swift and condign judgment. Through that sea of
blood Zimri only succeeded in wading to one week's
royalty, followed by a shameful and agonising death.
We are told that he did evil in the sight of the Lord
by following the sin of Jeroboam's calf-worship. The
phrase must be here something of a formula, for in
seven days he could hardly have achieved a religious
revolution, and every other king of Israel, some of
whom have long and prosperous reigns, maintained the
unauthorised worship. But Zimri's atrocious revolt
had been so ill-considered that it furnished a proverb
of the terrible fate of rebels.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> He had not even
attempted to secure the assent of the army at Gibbethon.
No sooner did the news reach the camp than
the soldiers tumultuously refused to accept Zimri as
king, and elected Omri their captain. Omri instantly
broke up the camp, and led them to besiege the new
king in Tirzah. Zimri saw that his cause was hopeless,
and took refuge in the fortress (<i>birah</i>) attached to
the palace.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> When he saw that even there he could
not maintain himself, he preferred speedy death to slow
starvation or falling into the hands of his rival. He
set fire to the palace, and, like Sardanapalus, perished
in the flames.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p>The swift suppression of his treason did not save
the unhappy kingdom from anarchy and civil war.
However popular Omri might be with the army, he
was unacceptable to a large part of the people. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
chose as their king a certain Tibni, son of Ginath,
who was supported by a powerful brother named
Joram. For four years the contest was continued.
At the end of that time Tibni and Joram were conquered
and killed,<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> and Omri began his sole reign, which
lasted eight years longer.</p>

<p>He founded the most conspicuous dynasty of Israel,
and so completely identified his name with the Northern
Kingdom that it was known to the Assyrians as Beit-Khumri,
or "the House of Omri."<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> They even speak
of Jehu the destroyer of Omri's dynasty, as "the son
of Omri."</p>

<p>Incidental allusions in the annals of his son show
that Omri was engaged in incessant wars against
Syria. He was unsuccessful, and Benhadad robbed him
of Ramoth Gilead and other cities, enforcing the right
of Syrians to have streets of their own even in his new
capital of Samaria.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> On the other hand, he was greatly
successful on the south-east against the Moabites and
their warrior-king Chemosh-Gad, the father of Mesha.</p>

<p>Few details of either war have come down to us.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>
We learn, however, from the famous Moabite stone
that he began his assault on Moab by the capture of
Mediba, several miles south of Heshbon, overran the
country, made the king a vassal, and imposed on Moab
the enormous annual tribute of 100,000 sheep and
100,000 rams.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> Mesha in his inscription records that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
Omri "oppressed Moab many days," and attributed
this to the fact that Chemosh was angry with his
chosen people.</p>

<p>He stamped his impress deep upon his subjects.
It must have been to him that the alliance with the
Tyrians was due, which in his son's reign produced
consequences so momentous. He "did worse we are
told than all the kings that were before him."<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> Although
he is only charged with walking in the way of Jeroboam,
the indignant manner in which the prophet Micah
speaks of "the statutes of Omri" as still being kept,<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>
seems to prove that his influence on religion was
condemned by the prophetic order on special grounds.
It is clear that he was a sovereign of far greater
eminence and importance than we might suppose from
the meagreness of his annals as here preserved; indeed,
for thirty-four years after his accession the history of
the Southern Kingdom becomes a mere appendix to
that of the Northern.</p>

<p>One conspicuous service he rendered to his subjects
by providing them with the city which became their
permanent and famous capital. This he did in the
sixth year of his reign. The burning of the fortress-palace
of Tirzah, and the rapidity with which the town
had succumbed to its besiegers, may have led him to
look out for a site, which was central, strong, and
beautiful. His choice was so prescient that the new
royal residence superseded not only Penuel and Tirzah,
but even Shechem. It was, says Dean Stanley, "as
though Versailles had taken the place of Paris, or
Windsor of London." He fixed his eye on an oblong
hill, with long flat summit, which rose in the midst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
of a wide valley encircled with hills, near the edge
of the plain of Sharon, and six miles north-west of
Shechem. Its beauty is still the admiration of the
traveller in Palestine. It gave point to the apostrophe
of Isaiah: "Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards
of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower,
which is on the head of the fat valleys of them that
are overcome with wine!... The crown of pride, the
drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under foot:
and the fading flower of his glorious adornment, which
is on the head of the fat valley, shall become as a fading
flower and as an early fig."<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> All around it the low
hills and rich ravines were clothed with fertility. They
recall more nearly than any other scene in Palestine
the green fields and parks of England.</p>

<p>It commanded a full view of the sea and the plain
of Sharon on the one hand, and of the vale of Shechem
on the other. The town sloped down from the summit
of this hill; a broad wall with a terraced top ran round
it. "In front of the gates was a wide open space
or threshing floor, where the kings of Samaria sat
on great occasions. The inferior houses were built
of white brick, with rafters of sycomore, the grandeur
of hewn stones and cedar (Isa. ix. 9, 10). Its soft,
rounded, oblong platform was, as it were, a vast luxurious
couch, in which the nobles securely rested, propped
and cushioned up on both sides, as in the cherished
corner of a rich divan."<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p>Far more important in the eyes of Omri than its
beauty was the natural strength of its position. It
did not possess the impregnable majesty of Jerusalem,
but its height and isolation, permitting of strong fortifications,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
enabled it to baffle the besieging hosts of the
Aramæans in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 901 and in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 892. For three long
years it held out against the mighty Assyrians under
Sargon and Shalmanezer. Its capture in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 721
involved the ruin of the whole kingdom in its fall.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>
Nebuchadnezzar took it in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 554, after a siege of
thirteen years. In later centuries it partially recovered.
Alexander the Great took it, and massacred many of
its inhabitants, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 332. John Hyrcanus, who took
it after a year's siege, tried to demolish it in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 129.
After various fortunes it was splendidly rebuilt by
Herod the Great, who called it Sebaste, in honour of
Augustus. It still exists under the name of Sebastïyeh.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p>When Omri chose it for his residence it belonged to
a certain Shemer, who, according to Epiphanius, was
a descendant of the ancient Perizzites or Girgashites.
The king paid for this hill the large sum of two talents
of silver,<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> and called it Shomeron. The name means
"a watch tower," and was appropriate both from its
commanding position and because it echoed the name
of its old possessor.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

<p>The new capital marked a new epoch. It superseded
as completely as Jerusalem had done the old local
shrines endeared by the immemorial sanctity of their
traditions; but as its origin was purely political it acted
unfavourably on the religion of the people. It became
a city of idolatry and of luxurious wealth; a city in
which Baal-worship with its ritual pomp threw into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
shade the worship of Jehovah; a city in which corrupted
nobles, lolling at wine feasts on rich divans in their
palaces inlaid with ivory, sold the righteous for silver
and the needy for a pair of shoes. Of Omri we are told
no more. After a reign of twelve years he slept with
his fathers, and was buried in the city which was to
be for so many centuries a memorial of his fame.</p>

<p>The name of Omri marks a new epoch. He is the first
Jewish king whose name is alluded to in Assyrian inscriptions.
Assyria had emerged into importance in the
twelfth century before Christ under Tiglath-Pileser I.,
but during the eleventh and down to the middle of the
tenth century it had sunk into inactivity. Assurbanipal,
the father of Shalmanezer II. (884-860), enlarged his
dominions to the Mediterranean westwards and to
Lebanon southwards. In 870, when Ahab was king,
the Assyrian warriors had exacted tribute from Tyre,
Sidon, and Biblos.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> It is not impossible that Omri
also had paid tribute, and it has even been conjectured
that it was to Assyrian help that he owed his throne.
The Book of Kings only alludes to the valour of this
warrior-king in the one word "his might";<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> but it is
evident from other indications that he had a stormy
and chequered reign.</p>

<p class="center">1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> xvi. 29-34.</p>


<p>Omri was succeeded by his son Ahab, whose
eventful reign of upwards of twenty years<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>
occupies so large a space even in these fragmentary
records. His name means "brother-father," and has
probably some sacred reference. He is stigmatised by
the historians as a king more wicked than his father,
though Omri had "done worse than all who were before
him.". That he was a brave warrior, and showed some
great qualities during a long and on the whole prosperous
career; that he built cities, and added to Israel
yet another royal residence; that he advanced the
wealth and prosperity of his subjects; that he was
highly successful in some of his wars against Syria,
and died in battle against those dangerous enemies
of his country; that he maintained unbroken, and
strengthened by yet closer affinity, the recent alliance
with the Southern Kingdom,&mdash;all this goes for nothing
with the prophetic annalists. They have no word of
eulogy for the king who added Baal-worship to the sin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
of Jeroboam. The prominence of Ahab in their record
is only due to the fact that he came into dreadful
collision with the prophetic order, and with Elijah, the
greatest prophet who had yet arisen. The glory and
the sins of the warrior-king interested the young
prophets of the schools solely because they were interwoven
with the grand and sombre traditions of their
mightiest reformer.</p>

<p>The historian traces all his ignominy and ruin to a
disastrous alliance. The kings of Judah had followed
the bad example of David and had been polygamists.
Up to this time the kings of Israel seem to have been
contented with a single wife. The wealth and power
of Ahab led him to adopt the costly luxury of a harem,
and he had seventy sons.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> This, however, would have
been regarded in those days as a venial offence, or
as no offence at all; but just as the growing power
of Solomon had been enhanced by marriage with a
princess of Egypt, so Ahab was now of sufficient
importance to wed a daughter of the King of Tyre.
"As though it had been a light thing for him to walk in
the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he took to wife
Jezebel, the daughter of Ethbaal, King of the Zidonians."</p>

<p>It was an act of policy in which religious considerations
went for nothing. There is little doubt that it
flattered his pride and the pride of his people, and that
Jezebel brought riches with her and pomp and the
prestige of luxurious royalty.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> The Ph&#339;nicians were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
of the old race of Canaan, with whom all affinity was so
strongly forbidden. Ethbaal&mdash;more accurately, perhaps,
Itto-baal (Baal is with him)<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>&mdash;though he ruled all
Ph&#339;nicia, both Tyre and Sidon, was a usurper, and had
been the high priest of the great Temple of Ashtoreth
in Tyre. Hiram, the friend of Solomon, had now been
dead for half a century. The last king of his dynasty
was the fratricide Phelles, whom in his turn his brother
Ethbaal slew. He reigned for thirty-two years, and
founded a dynasty which lasted for sixty-two years
more. He was the seventh successor to the throne of
Tyre in the fifty years which had elapsed since the
death of Hiram. Menander of Ephesus, as quoted by
Josephus, shows us that in the history of this family
we find an interesting point of contact between sacred
and classic history. Jezebel was the aunt of Virgil's
Belus, and great-aunt of Pygmalion, and of Dido, the
famous foundress of Carthage.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>A king named after Baal, and who had named his
daughter after Baal&mdash;a king whose descendants down
to Maherbal and Hasdrubal and Hannibal bore the
name of the Sun-god<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>&mdash;a king who had himself been at
the head of the cult of Ashtoreth, the female deity who
was worshipped with Baal&mdash;was not likely to rest
content until he had founded the worship of his god in
the realm of his son-in-law. Ahab, we are told, "went
and served Baal and worshipped him." We must
discount by recorded facts the impression which might
<i>primâ facie</i> be left by these sweeping denunciations.
It is certain that to his death Ahab continued to
recognise Jehovah. He enshrined the name of Jehovah
in the names of his children.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> He consulted the
prophets of Jehovah, and his continuance of the calf-worship
met with no recorded reproof from the many
true prophets who were active during his reign. The
worship of Baal was due to nothing more than the
unwise eclecticism which had induced Solomon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
establish the <i>Bamoth</i> to heathen deities on the mount of
offence. It is exceedingly probable that the permission
of Baal-worship had been one of the articles of the
treaty between Tyre and Israel, which, as we know
from Amos, had been made at this time. It had
probably been the condition on which the fanatical
Ph&#339;nician usurper had conceded to his far less powerful
neighbour the hand of his daughter. It was, as we see,
alike in sacred and secular history a time of treaties.
The menacing spectre of Assyria was beginning to
terrify the nations. Hamath, Syria, and the Hittites
had formed a league of defence against the northern
power, and similar motives induced the kings of Israel to
seek alliance with Ph&#339;nicia. Perhaps neither Omri nor
Ahab grasped all the consequences of their concession
to the Sidonian princess.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> But such compacts were
against the very essence of the religion of Israel, which
was "Yahveh Israel's God, and Israel Yahveh's people."</p>

<p>The new queen inherited the fanaticism as she
inherited the ferocity of her father. She acquired
from the first a paramount sway over the weak and
uxorious mind of her husband. Under her influence
Ahab built in Samaria a splendid temple and altar to
Baal, in which no less than four hundred orgiastic
priests served the Ph&#339;nician idol in splendid vestments,
and with the same pompous ritual as in the shrines at
Tyre. In front of this temple, to the disgust and horror
of all faithful worshippers of Jehovah, stood an <i>Asherah</i>
in honour of the Nature-goddess, and <i>Matstseboth</i>
pillars or obelisks which represented either sunbeams
or the reproductive powers of nature. In these ways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
Ahab "did more to provoke the Lord God to anger
than all the kings of Israel that were before him."<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>
When we learn what Baal was, and how he was worshipped,
we are not surprised at so stern a condemnation.
Half Sun-god, half Bacchus, half Hercules, Baal
was worshipped under the image of a bull, "the symbol
of the male power of generation." In the wantonness
of his rites he was akin to Peor; in their cruel atrocity
to the kindred Moloch; in the demand for victims to
be sacrificed to the horrible consecration of lust and
blood he resembled the Minotaur, the wallowing
"infamy of Crete," with its yearly tribute of youths
and maidens. What the combined worship of Baal
and Asherah was like&mdash;and by Jezebel with Ahab's
connivance they were now countenanced in Samaria&mdash;we
may learn from the description of their temple at
Apheka.<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> It confirms what we are incidentally told of
Jezebel's devotions. It abounded in wealthy gifts, and
its multitude of priests, women, and mutilated ministers&mdash;of
whom Lucian counted three hundred at one sacrifice&mdash;were
clad in splendid vestments. Children were
sacrificed by being put in a leathern bag and flung
down from the top of the temple, with the shocking
expression that "they were calves, not children." In
the forecourt stood two gigantic phalli. The <i>Galli</i> were
maddened into a tumult of excitement by the uproar
of drums, shrill pipes, and clanging cymbals, gashed
themselves with knives and potsherds, and often ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
through the city in women's dress.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> Such was the new
worship with which the dark murderess insulted the
faith in Jehovah. Could any condemnation be too
stern for the folly and faithlessness of the king who
sanctioned it?</p>

<p>A consequence of this tolerance of polluted forms of
worship seems to have shown itself in defiant contempt
for sacred traditions. At any rate, it is in this connexion
that we are told how Hiel of Bethel set at
naught an ancient curse. After the fall of Jericho Joshua
had pronounced a curse upon the site of the city. It
was never to be rebuilt, but to remain under the ban
of God. The site, indeed, had not been absolutely
uninhabited, for its importance near the fords of Jordan
necessitated the existence of some sort of caravanserai
in or near the spot.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> At this time it belonged to the
kingdom of Israel, though it was in the district of
Benjamin and afterwards reverted to Judah.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> Hiel,
struck by the opportunities afforded by its position,
laughed the old <i>cherem</i> to scorn, and determined to
rebuild Jericho into a fortified and important city. But
men remarked with a shudder that the curse had not
been uttered in vain. The laying of the foundation
was marked by the death of his firstborn Abiram, the
completion of the gates by the death of Segub, his
youngest son.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The shadow of Queen Jezebel falls dark for many
years over the history of Israel and Judah. She was
one of those masterful, indomitable, implacable women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
who, when fate places them in exalted power, leave
a terrible mark on the annals of nations. What the
Empress Irene was in the history of Constantinople,
or the "She-wolf of France" in that of England, or
Catherine de Medicis in that of France, that Jezebel
was in the history of Palestine. The unhappy Juana
of Spain left a physical trace upon her descendants in
the perpetuation of the huge jaw which had gained her
the soubriquet of <i>Maultasch</i>; but the trace left by
Jezebel was marked in blood in the fortunes of the
children born to her. Already three of the six kings of
Israel had been murdered, or had come to evil ends; but
the fate of Ahab and his house was most disastrous of
all, and it became so through the "whoredoms and witchcrafts"
of his Sidonian wife. A thousand years later
the name of Jezebel was still ominous as that of one who
seduced others into fornication and idolatry.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> If no king
so completely "sold himself to work wickedness" as
Ahab, it was because "Jezebel his wife stirred him up."<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>

<p>Yet, however guilty may have been the uxorious
apostasies of Ahab, he can hardly be held to be responsible
for the marriage itself. The dates and ages
recorded for us show decisively that the alliance must
have been negotiated by Omri, for it took place in
his reign and when Ahab was too young to have much
voice in the administration of the kingdom. He is
only responsible for abdicating his proper authority
over Jezebel, and for permitting her a free hand in
the corruption of worship, while he gave himself up
to his schemes of worldly aggrandisement. Absorbed
in the strengthening of his cities and the embellishment
of his ivory palaces, he became neglectful of the worship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
of Jehovah, and careless of the more solemn and sacred
duties of a theocratic king.</p>

<p>The temple to Baal at Samaria was built; the hateful
Asherah in front of it offended the eyes of all whose
hearts abhorred an impure idolatry. Its priests and
the priests of Astarte were the favourites of the court.
Eight hundred and fifty of them fed in splendour at
Jezebel's table, and the pomp of their sensuous cult
threw wholly into the shade the worship of the God
of Israel. Hitherto there had been no protest against,
no interference with the course of evil. It had been
suffered to reach its meridian unchecked, and it seemed
only a question of time that the service of Jehovah
would yield to that of Baal, to whose favour the queen
probably believed that her priestly father had owed
his throne. There are indications that Jezebel had
gone further still, and that Ahab, however much he
may secretly have disapproved, had not interfered to
prevent her. For although we do not know the exact
period at which Jezebel began to exercise violence
against the worshippers of Jehovah, it is certain that
she did so. This crime took place before the great
famine which was appointed for its punishment, and
which roused from cowardly torpor the supine conscience
of the king and of the nation. Jezebel stands out on
the page of sacred history as the first supporter of
<i>religious persecution</i>. We learn from incidental notices
that, not content with insulting the religion of the nation
by the burdensome magnificence of her idolatrous
establishments, she made an attempt to crush Jehovah-worship
altogether. Such fanaticism is a frequent
concomitant of guilt. She is the authentic authoress
of priestly inquisitions.</p>

<p>The Borgian monster, Pope Alexander VI., who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
founded the Spanish Inquisition, is the lineal inheritor
of the traditions of Jezebel. Had Ahab done no more
than Solomon had done in Judah, the followers of the
true faith in Israel would have been as deeply offended
as those of the Southern Kingdom. They would have
hated a toleration which they regarded as wicked, because
it involved moral corruption as well as the danger of
national apostasy. Their feelings would have been even
more wrathful than were stirred in the hearts of English
Puritans when they heard of the Masses in the chapel
of Henrietta Maria, or saw Father Petre gliding about
the corridors of Whitehall. But their opposition was
crushed with a hand of iron. Jezebel, strong in her
<i>entourage</i> of no less than eight hundred and fifty priests,
to say nothing of her other attendants, audaciously
broke down the altars of Jehovah&mdash;even the lonely
one on Mount Carmel&mdash;and endeavoured so completely
to extirpate all the prophets of Jehovah that Elijah
regarded himself as the sole prophet that was left.
Those who escaped her fury had to wander about in
destitution, and to hide in dens and caves of the earth.</p>

<p>The apostasy of Churches always creeps on apace,
when priests and prophets, afraid of malediction, and
afraid of imperilling their worldly interests become
cowards, opportunists, and time-servers, and not daring
to speak out the truth that is in them, suffer the cause
of spirituality and righteousness to go by default. But
"when Iniquity hath played her part, Vengeance,
leaps upon the stage. The comedy is short, but the
tragedy is long. The black guard shall attend upon
you: you shall eat at the table of sorrow, and the
crown of death shall be upon your heads, many
glittering faces looking upon you."<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p>Many chapters are now occupied with narratives
of the deeds of two great prophets, Elijah and
Elisha, remarkable for the blaze and profusion of
miracles and for similarity in many details. For thirty-four
years we hear but little of Judah, and the kings of
Israel are overshadowed by the "men of God." Both
narratives, of which the later in sequence seems to be
the earlier in date, originated in the Schools of the
Prophets. Both are evidently drawn from documentary
sources apart from the ordinary annals of the Kings.</p>

<p>Doubtless something of their fragmentariness is due
to the abbreviation of the prophetic annals by the
historians.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with abrupt impetuosity, the mighty figure
of Elijah the Prophet bursts upon the scene like lightning
on the midnight. So far as the sacred page is
concerned, he, like Melchizedek, is "without father,
without mother, without descent." He appears before
us unannounced as "Elijah the Tishbite of the inhabitants
of Gilead." Such a phenomenon as Jezebel
explains and necessitates such a phenomenon as Elijah.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
"The loftiest and sternest spirit of the true faith is
raised up," says Dean Stanley, "face to face with
the proudest and fiercest spirit of the old Asiatic
Paganism."</p>

<p>The name Elijah, or, in its fuller and more sonorous
Hebrew form, Elijahu, means "Jehovah is my God."
Who he was is entirely unknown. So completely is all
previous trace of him lost in mystery that Talmudic
legends confounded him with Phinehas, the son of
Aaron, the avenging and fiercely zealous priest; and
even identified him with the angel or messenger of
Jehovah who appeared to Gideon and ascended in the
altar flame.</p>

<p>The name "Tishbite" tells us nothing. No town of
Tishbi occurs in Scripture, and though a Thisbe in the
tribe of Naphtali is mentioned as the birthplace of
Tobit,<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> the existence of such a place is as doubtful as
that of "Thesbon of the Gileadite district" to which
Josephus assigns his birth.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> The Hebrew may mean
"the Tishbite from Tishbi of Gilead," or "<i>The sojourner
from the sojourners of Gilead</i>"; and we know no more.
Elijah's grandeur is in himself alone. Perhaps he was
by birth an Ishmaelite. When the wild Highlander in
Rob Roy says of himself "I am a man," "A man!"
repeated Frank Osbaldistone; "that is a very brief
description." "It will serve," answered the outlaw,
"for one who has no other to give. He who is without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
name, without friends, without coin, without country,
is still at least a man: and he that has all these is no
more." So Elijah stands alone in the towering height
of his fearless manhood.</p>

<p>Some clue to the swift mysterious movements, the
rough asceticism, the sheepskin robe, the unbending
sternness of the Prophet may lie in the notice that he
was a Gileadite, or at any rate among the sojourners
of Gilead, and therefore akin to them. It might even
be conjectured that he was of Kenite origin, like
Jonadab, the son of Rechab, in the days of Jehu.<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> The
Gileadites were the Highlanders of Palestine, and the
name of their land implies its barren ruggedness.<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>
They, like the modern Druses, were</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fierce, hardy, proud, in conscious freedom bold."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We catch a glimpse of these characteristics in the notice
of the four hundred Gadites who swam the Jordan in
Palestine to join the freebooters of David in the cave
of Adullam, "whose faces were like the faces of lions,
and who were as swift as the roes upon the mountains."
Though of Israelitish origin they were closely akin to
the Bedawin, swift, strong, temperate, fond of the great
solitudes of nature, haters of cities, scorners of the
softnesses of civilisation. Elijah shared these characteristics.
Like the forerunner of Christ, in whom his
spirit reappeared nine centuries later, he had lived alone
with God in the glowing deserts and the mountain fastnesses.
He found Jehovah's presence, not in the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Gay religions, full of pomp and gold,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which he misdoubted and despised, but in the barren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
hills and wild ravines and bleak uplands where only
here and there roamed a shepherd with his flock. In
such hallowed loneliness he had learnt to fear man
little, because he feared God much, and to dwell
familiarly on the sterner aspects of religion and morality.
The one conscious fact of his mission, the sufficient
authentication of his most imperious mandates, was
that "he stood before Jehovah." So unexpected were
his appearances and disappearances, that in the popular
view he only seemed to flash to and fro, or to be swept
hither and thither, by the Spirit of the Lord. We may
say of him as was said of John the Baptist, that "in
his manifestation and agency he was like a burning
torch; his public life was quite an earthquake; the
whole man was a sermon, the voice of one crying in
the wilderness." And, like the Baptist, he had been
"in the deserts, till the day of his showing unto Israel."</p>

<p>Somewhere&mdash;perhaps at Samaria, perhaps in the
lovely summer palace at Jezreel&mdash;he suddenly strode
into the presence of Ahab. Coming to him as the
messenger of the King of kings he does not deign
to approach him with the genuflexions and sounding
titles which Nathan used to the aged David. With
scanted courtesy to one whom he does not respect or
dread&mdash;knowing that he is in God's hands, and has
no time to waste over courtly periphrases or personal
fears&mdash;he comes before Ahab unknown, unintroduced.
What manner of man was it by whom the king in
his crown and Tyrian purple was thus rudely confronted?
He was, tradition tells us, a man of short
stature, of rugged countenance. He was "a lord of
hair"&mdash;the thick black locks of the Nazarite (for such
he probably was) streamed over his shoulders like a
lion's mane, giving him a fierce and unkempt aspect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
They that wear soft clothing are in king's houses,
and doubtless under a queen who, even in old age,
painted her face and tired her head, and was given
to Sidonian luxuries, Ahab was accustomed to see
men about him in bright apparel. But Elijah had
not stooped to alter his ordinary dress, which was the
dress of the desert by which he was always known.
His brown limbs, otherwise bare, were covered with
a heavy mantle, the skin of a camel or a sheep worn
with the rough wool outside, and tightened round his
loins by a leathern girdle. So unusual was his aspect
in the cities east of Jordan, accustomed since the days
of Solomon to all the refinements of Egyptian and
Ph&#339;nician culture, that it impressed and haunted the
imagination of his own and of subsequent ages. The
dress of Elijah became so normally the dress of
prophets who would fain have assumed his authority
without one spark of his inspiration, that the later
Zechariah has to warn his people against sham prophets
who appeared with hairy garments, and who wounded
their own hands for no other purpose than to deceive.<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>
The robe of skin, after the long interspace of centuries,
was still the natural garb of "the glorious eremite,"
who in his spirit and power made straight in the
deserts a highway for our God.</p>

<p>Such was the man who delivered to Ahab in one
sentence his tremendous message: "As Jehovah, God
of Israel, liveth, before whom I stand"&mdash;such was the
introductory formula, which became proverbial, and
which authenticated the prophecy&mdash;"There shall not be
dew<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> nor rain these years but according to my word."
The phrase "to stand before Jehovah" was used of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
priests: it was applicable to a prophet in a far deeper
and less external sense.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> Drought was one of the
recognised Divine punishments for idolatrous apostasy.
If Israel should fall into disobedience, we read in
Deuteronomy, "the Lord shall make the rain of thy land
powder and dust; from heaven shall it come down upon
thee&mdash;until thou be destroyed"; and in Leviticus we
read, "If ye will not hearken, I will make your heaven
as iron and your earth as brass." The threat was too
significant to need any explanation. The conscience
of Ahab could interpret only too readily that prophetic
menace.</p>

<p>The message of Elijah marked the beginning of a
three, or three and a half years' famine. This historic
drought is also mentioned by Menander of Tyre, who
says that after a year, at the prayer of Ethbaal, the
priest and king, there came abundant thunder showers.
St. James represents the famine as well as its termination
as having been caused by Elijah's prayer.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> But
the expression of the historian is general. Elijah might
pray for rain, but no prophet could, <i>proprio motu</i>, have
offered up a prayer for so awful a curse upon an entire
country as a famine, in which thousands of the innocent
would suffer no less severely than the guilty. Three
years' famine was a recognised penalty for apostasy.
It was one of the sore plagues of God. It had befallen
Judah "because of Saul and his bloody house,"<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> and
had been offered to guilty David as an alternative for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
three days' pestilence, or three years' flight before his
enemies.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> We are not here told that Elijah prayed
for it, but that he announced its commencement, and
declared that only in accordance with his announcement
should it close.</p>

<p>He delivered his message, and what followed we do
not know. Ahab's tolerance was great; and, however
fierce may have been his displeasure, he seems in most
cases to have personally respected the sacredness and
dignity of the prophets. The king's wrath might provoke
an outburst of sullenness, but he contented himself
with menacing and reproachful words. It was otherwise
with Jezebel. A genuine idolatress, she hated the
servants of Jehovah with implacable hatred, and did
her utmost to suppress them by violence. It was probably
to save Elijah from her fury that he was bidden
to fly into safe hiding, while her foiled rage expended
itself in the endeavour to extirpate the whole body of
the prophets of the Lord. But, just as the child Christ
was saved when Herod massacred the infants of Bethlehem,
so Elijah, at whom Jezebel's blow was chiefly
aimed, had escaped beyond her reach. A hundred
other imperilled prophets were hidden in a cave by the
faithfulness of Obadiah, the king's vizier.</p>

<p>The word of the Lord bade Elijah to fly eastward
and hide himself "in the brook Cherith,<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> that is before
Jordan." The site of this ravine&mdash;which Josephus
only calls "a certain torrent bed"&mdash;has not been identified.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
It was doubtless one of the many wadies which
run into the deep Ghôr or cleft of the Jordan on its
eastern side. If it belonged to his native Gilead, Elijah
would be in little fear of being discovered by the
emissaries whom Ahab sent in every direction to seek
for him. Whether it was the Wady Kelt,<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> or the
Wady el Jabis,<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> or the Ain Fusail,<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> we know the exact
characteristics of the scene. On either side, deep,
winding and precipitous, rise the steep walls of rock,
full of tropic foliage, among which are conspicuous the
small dark green leaves and stiff thorns of the nubk.
Far below the summit of the ravine, marking its almost
imperceptible thread of water by the brighter green of
the herbage, and protected by masses of dewy leaves
from the fierce power of evaporation, the hidden torrent
preserves its life in all but the most long-continued
periods of drought. In such a scene Elijah was absolutely
safe. Whenever danger approached he could
hide himself in some fissure or cavern of the beetling
crags where the wild birds have their nest, or sit
motionless under the dense screen of interlacing boughs.
The wildness and almost terror of his surroundings
harmonised with his stern and fearless spirit. A spirit
like his would rejoice in the unapproachable solitude,
communing with God alike when the sun flamed in the
zenith and when the midnight hung over him with all
its stars.</p>

<p>The needs of an Oriental&mdash;particularly of an ascetic
Bedawy prophet&mdash;are small as those of the simplest
hermit. Water and a few dates often suffice him for
days together. Elijah drank of the brook, and God
"had commanded the ravens to feed him there." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
shy, wild, unclean birds<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> "brought him"&mdash;so the
old prophetic narrative tells us&mdash;"bread and flesh in
the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening." We
may remark in passing, that flesh twice a day or even
once a day, if with Josephus we read "bread in the
morning and flesh in the evening," is no part of an
Arab's ordinary food. It is regarded by him as wholly
needless, and indeed as an exceptional indulgence.
The double meal of flesh does not resemble the simple
diet of bread and water on which the Prophet lived
afterwards at Sarepta. Are we or are we not to take
this as a literal fact? Here we are face to face with
a plain question to which I should deem it infamous
to give a false or a prevaricating answer.</p>

<p>Before giving it, let us clear the ground. First of all,
it is a question which can only be answered by serious
criticism. Assertion can add nothing to it, and is
not worth the breath with which it is uttered. The
anathemas of obsolete and <i>a priori</i> dogmatism against
those who cannot take the statement as simple fact do
not weigh so much as a dead autumn leaf in the minds
of any thoughtful men.</p>

<p>Some holy but uninstructed soul may say, "It stands
on the sacred page: why should you not understand it
literally?" It might be sufficient to answer, Because
there are many utterances on the sacred page which
are purely poetic or metaphorical. "The eye that
mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his
mother, the ravens of the brook shall pick it out, and
the young vultures shall eat it."<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> The statement looks
prosaic and positive enough, but what human being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
ever took it literally? "Curse not the king&mdash;for a
bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which
hath wings shall tell the matter." Who does not see
at once that the words are poetic and metaphorical?
"Where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not
quenched." How many educated Christians can assert
that they believe that the unredeemed will be eaten for
ever by literal worms in endless flames? The man
who pretends that he is obliged to understand literally
the countless Scriptural metaphors involved in an
Eastern language of which nearly every word is a
pictorial metaphor, only shows himself incompetent
to pronounce an opinion on subjects connected with
history, literature, or religious criticism.</p>

<p>Is it then out of dislike to the supernatural, or disbelief
in its occurrence, that the best critics decline to
take the statement literally?</p>

<p>Not at all. Most Christians have not the smallest
difficulty in accepting the supernatural. If they believe
in the stupendous miracles of the Incarnation and the
Resurrection, what possible difficulty could they have
in accepting any other event merely on the ground that
it is miraculous? To many Christians all life seems to
be one incessant miracle. Disbelieving that any force
less than the fiat of God could have thrilled into
inorganic matter the germs of vegetable and still more
of animal life; believing that their own life is supernatural,
and that they are preserved as they were
created by endless cycles of ever-recurrent miracles;
believing that the whole spiritual life is supernatural
in its every characteristic; they have not the slightest
unwillingness to believe a miracle when any real
evidence can be adduced for it. They accept, without
the smallest misgiving, the miracles of Jesus Christ our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
Lord, radiating as ordinary works from His Divine
nature, performed in the full blaze of history, attested
by hundredfold contemporary evidence, leading to
results of world-wide and eternal significance&mdash;miracles
which were, so to speak, natural, normal, and necessary,
and of which each revealed some deep moral or spiritual
truth. But if miracles can only rest on evidence, the
dullest and least instructed mind can see that the
evidence for this and for some other miracles in this
narrative stands on a wholly different footing. Taken
apart from dogmatic assertions which are themselves
unproven or disproved, the evidence that ravens daily
fed Elijah is wholly inadequate to sustain the burden
laid upon it.</p>

<p>In the first place, the story occurs in a book compiled
some centuries after the event which it attests;
in a book solemn indeed and sacred, but composite,
and in some of its details not exempt from the
accidents which have always affected all human
literature.</p>

<p>And this incident is unattested by any other evidence.
It is, so to speak, isolated. It is quite separable from
the historic features of the narrative, and is out of
accordance with what is truly called the Divine
economy of miracles. No miracle was wrought to
supply Elijah with water; and if a miracle was needed
to supply him with bread and flesh, it is easy to
imagine hundreds of forms of such direct interposition
which would be more normal and more in accordance
with all other Scripture miracles than the continuous
overruling of the natural instincts of ravenous birds.
It has been said that this particular form of miracle
was needed for its evidential value; but there is
nothing in the narrative to imply that it had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
smallest evidential value for any one of Elijah's contemporaries,
or even that they knew of it at all.</p>

<p>Further, we find it, not in a plain prose narrative,
but in a narrative differing entirely from the prosaic
setting in which it occurs&mdash;a narrative which rises in
many parts to the height of poetic and imaginative
splendour. There is nothing to show that it was not
intended to be a touch of imaginative poetry and nothing
more. Part of the greatness of Hebrew literature lies
in its power of conveying eternal truth, as, for instance,
in the Book of Job and in many passages of the prophets,
in the form of imaginative narration. The stories of
Elijah and Elisha come from the Schools of the Prophets.
If room was left in them for the touch of poetic fiction,
or for the embellishment of history with moral truth,
conveyed in the form of parable or apologue, we can
at once account for the sudden multitude of miracles.
They were founded no doubt in many instances on
actual events, but in the form into which the narrative
is thrown they were recorded to enhance the greatness
of the heroic chiefs of the Schools of the Prophets. It
is therefore uncertain whether the original narrator
believed, or meant his readers literally to believe, such
a statement as that Elijah was fed morning and evening
by actual ravens. It cannot be proved that he intended
more than a touch of poetry, by which he could convey
the lesson that the prophet was maintained by marked
interventions of that providence of God which is itself
in all its workings supernatural. God's feeding of the
ravens in their nest was often alluded to in Hebrew
poetry; and if the marvellous support of the Prophet
in his lonely hiding-place was to be represented in an
imaginative form, this way of representing it would
naturally occur to the writer's thoughts. Similarly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
when Jerome wrote the purely fictitious life of Paul
the Hermit, which was taken for fact even by his
contemporaries, he thinks it quite natural to say that
Paul and Antony saw a raven sitting on a tree, who
flew gently down to them and placed a loaf on the
table before them. Ravens haunt the lonely, inaccessible
cliffs among which Elijah found his place of refuge.
It needed but a touch of metaphor to transform them
into ministers of Heaven's beneficence.</p>

<p>But besides all this, the word rendered ravens
(<i>Orebim</i>, &#1506;&#1465;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;) only has that meaning if it be written
with the vowel points. But the vowel points are confessedly
not "inspired" in any sense, but are a late
Massoretic invention. Without the change of a letter
the word may equally well mean people of the city
Orbo,<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> or of the rock Oreb (as was suggested even in
the Bereshith Rabba by Rabbi Judah); or "merchants,"
as in Ezek. xxvii. 27; or Arabians. No doubt difficulties
might be suggested about any of these interpretations;
but which would be most reasonable, the
acceptance of such small difficulties, or the literal acceptance
of a stupendous miracle, unlike any other in the
Bible, by which we are to believe on the isolated
authority of a nameless and long subsequent writer,
that, for months or weeks together, voracious and
unclean birds brought bread and flesh to the Prophet
twice a day? The old naturalistic attempts to explain
the miracle are on the face of them absurd; but it is
as perfectly open to any one who chooses to say that
"Arabians," or "Orbites," or "merchants," or "people
of the rock Oreb" fed Elijah, as to say that the "ravens"
did so. The explanation now universally accepted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
the Higher Criticism is different. It is to accept the
meaning "ravens," but not with wooden literalness
to interpret didactic and poetic symbolism as though
it were bald and matter-of-fact prose. The imagery of
a grand religious <i>Haggada</i> is not to be understood, nor
was it ever meant to be understood, like the page of
a dull annalist. Analogous stories are found abundantly
alike in early pagan and early Christian literature and
in mediæval hagiology. They are true in essence
though not in fact, and the intention of them is often
analogous to this; but no story is found so noble as
this in its pure and quiet simplicity.</p>

<p>Let this then suffice and render it needless to recur
to similar discussions. If any think themselves bound
to interpret this and all the other facts in these narratives
in their most literal sense; if they hold that the
mere mention of such things by unknown writers in
unknown time&mdash;possibly centuries afterwards, when the
event may have become magnified by the refraction of
tradition&mdash;is sufficient to substantiate them, let them
hold their own opinion as long as it can satisfy them.
But <i>proof</i> of such an opinion they neither have nor can
have; and let them beware of priding themselves on the
vaunt of their "faith," when such "faith" may haply
prove to be no more than a distortion of the truer faith
which proves all things and only holds fast that which
will stand the test. A belief based on some <i>a priori</i>
opinion about "verbal dictation" is not necessarily meritorious.
It may be quite the reverse. Such a dogma
has never been laid down by the Church in general.
It has very rarely been insisted upon by any branch
of the Church in any age. A belief which prides itself
on ignorance of the vast horizon opened to us by the
study of many forms of literature, by the advance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
criticism, by the science of comparative religion&mdash;so far
from being religious or spiritual may only be a sign of
ignorance, or of a defective love of truth. A dogmatism
which heaps upon intelligent faith burdens at once
needless and intolerable may spring from sources which
should tend to self-humiliation rather than to spiritual
pride.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> <i>Abundet quisque in sensu suo.</i> But such
beliefs have not the smallest connexion with true
faith or sincere Christianity. God is a God of truth,
and he who tries to force himself into a view which
history and literature, no less than the faithful following
of the Divine light within him, convince him to be
untenable, does not rise into faith, but sins and does
mischief by feebleness and <i>lack</i> of faith.<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></p>

<p>The fierce drought continued, and "at the end
of days"<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> even the thin trickling of the stream
in the clefts of Cherith was dried up. In the language
of Job it felt the glare and vanished.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> No miracle was
wrought to supply the Prophet with water, but once
more the providence of God intervened to save his life
for the mighty work which still awaited him. He was
sent to the region where, nearly a millennium later, the
feet of his Lord followed him on a mission of mercy
to those other sheep of His flock who were not of the
Judæan fold.</p>

<p>The word of the Lord bade him make his way to the
Sidonian city of Zarephath. Zarephath, the Sarepta
of St. Luke, the modern Surafend, lay between Tyre
and Sidon, and there the waters would not be wholly
dried up, for the fountains of Lebanon were not yet
exhausted. The drought had extended to Ph&#339;nicia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>
but Elijah was told that there a widow woman would
sustain him. The Baal-worshipping queen who had
hunted for his life would be least of all likely to search
for him in a city of Baal-worshippers in the midst of
her own people. He is sent among these Baal-worshippers
to do them kindness, to receive kindness
from them&mdash;perhaps to learn a wider tolerance, and to
find that idolaters also are human beings, children,
like the orthodox, of the same heavenly Father. He
had been taught the lesson of "dependence upon
God": he was now to learn the lesson of "fellowship
with man." Travelling probably by night both for
coolness and for safety, Elijah went that long journey
to the heathen district. He arrived there faint with
hunger and thirst. Seeing a woman gathering sticks
near the city gate he asked her for some water, and
as she was going to fetch it he called to her and asked
her also to bring him a morsel of bread. The answer
revealed the condition of extreme want to which she
was reduced. Recognising that Elijah was an Israelite,
and therefore a worshipper of Jehovah, she said, "As
Jehovah thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but (only)
a handful of meal in the barrel, and a little oil in the
cruse." She was gathering a couple of sticks to make
one last meal for herself and her son, and then to lie
down and die.<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> For drought did not only mean universal
anguish, but much actual starvation. It meant,
as Joel says, speaking of the desolation caused by
locusts, that the cattle groan and perish, and the corn
withers, and the seeds rot under their clods.</p>

<p>Strong in faith Elijah told her not to fear, but first
to supply his own more urgent needs, and then to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
make a meal for herself and her son. Till Jehovah
sent rain, the barrel of meal should not waste, nor the
cruse of oil fail. She believed the promise, and for
many days, perhaps for two whole years, the Prophet
continued to be her guest.</p>

<p>But after a time her boy fell grievously sick, and
at last died, or seemed to die.<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> So dread a calamity&mdash;the
smiting of the stay of her home, and the son
of her widowhood&mdash;filled the woman with terror. She
longed to get rid of the presence of this terrible "man
of God."<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> He must have come, she thought, to bring
her sin to remembrance before God, and so to cause
Him to slay her son. The Prophet was touched by
the pathos of her appeal, and could not bear that she
should look upon him as the cause of her bereavement.
"Give me thy son," he said. Taking the dead boy
from her arms, he carried him to the chamber which
she had set apart for him, and laid him on his own
bed. Then, after an earnest cry to God, he stretched
himself three times over the body of the youth, as
though to breathe into his lungs and restore his vital
warmth, at the same time praying intensely that "his
soul might come into him again."<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> His prayer was
heard; the boy revived. Carrying him down from the
chamber, Elijah had the happiness of restoring him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
his widowed mother with the words, "See, thy son
liveth." So remarkable an event not only convinced
the woman that Elijah was indeed what she had called
him, "a man of God," but also that Jehovah was the
true God. It was not unnatural that tradition should
interest itself in the boy thus strangely snatched from
the jaws of death. The Jews fancied that he grew
up to be servant of Elijah, and afterwards to be
the prophet Jonah. The tradition at least shows an
insight into the fact that Elijah was the first missionary
sent from among the Jews to the heathen, and that
Jonah became the second.</p>

<p>We are not to suppose that during his stay at
Zarephath Elijah remained immured in his chamber.
Safe and unsuspected, he might, at least by night,
make his way to other places, and it is reasonable to
believe that he then began to haunt the glades and
heights of beautiful and deserted Carmel, which was at
no great distance, and where he could mourn over the
ruined altar of Jehovah and take refuge in any of its
"more than two thousand tortuous caves." But what
was the object of his being sent to Zarephath? That
it was not for his own sake alone, that it had in it
a purpose of conversion, is distinctly implied by our
Lord when He says that in those days there were
many widows in Israel, yet Elijah was not sent to
them, but to this Sidonian idolatress. The prophets
and saints of God do not always understand the meaning
of Providence or the lessons of their Divine training.
Francis of Assisi at first entirely misunderstood the
real drift and meaning of the Divine intimations that
he was to rebuild the ruined Church of God, which he
afterwards so gloriously fulfilled. The thoughts of
God are not as man's thoughts, nor His ways as man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
ways, nor does He make all His servants as it were
"fusile apostles," as He made St. Paul. The education
of Elijah was far from complete even long afterwards.
To the very last, if we are to accept the records
of him as historically literal, amid the revelations vouchsafed
to him he had not grasped the truth that the
Elijah-spirit, however needful it may seem to be, differs
very widely from the Spirit of the Lord of Life. Yet
may it not have been that Elijah was sent to learn from
the kind ministrations of a Sidonian widow, to whose
care his life was due, some inkling of those truths which
Christ revealed so many centuries afterwards, when He
visited the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, and extended His
mercy to the great faith of the Syro-Ph&#339;nician woman?
May not Elijah have been meant to learn what had to
be taught by experience to the two great Apostles of
the Circumcision and the Uncircumcision, that not every
Baal-worshipper was necessarily corrupt or wholly
insincere? St. Peter was thus taught that God is no
respecter of persons, and that whether their religious
belief be false or true, in every nation he that feareth
Him and doeth righteousness is accepted of Him.
St. Paul learnt at Damascus and taught at Athens
that God made of one every nation of men to dwell on
the face of the earth, that they should seek God if
haply they might feel after Him and find Him, though
He be not far from every one of us.</p>

<h3><i>ELIJAH AND AHAB.</i></h3>

<p class="center">1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span>, xviii. 1-19.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Return, oh backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings.
Behold, we come unto thee; for Thou art Jehovah our God. Truly
in vain is salvation hoped for from the tumult (of votaries) upon the
mountains. Truly in Jehovah our God is the salvation of Israel.
And the Shame (<i>i.e.</i>, Baal) hath devoured the labour of our fathers."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jer.</span>
iii. 22-24.</p></blockquote>


<p>Elijah stayed long with the Sidonian widow, safe
in that obscure concealment, and with his simple
wants supplied. But at last the word of the Lord came
to him with the conviction that the drought had accomplished
its appointed end in impressing the souls of
king and people, and that the time was come for some
immense and decisive demonstration against the prevalent
apostasy. All his sudden movements, all his
stern incisive utterances were swayed by his allegiance
to Jehovah before whom he stood, and he now received
the command, "Go, show thyself unto Ahab; and I will
send rain upon the earth."</p>

<p>To obey such a mandate showed the strength of his
faith. It is clear that even before the menace of the
thought he had been known, and unfavourably known,
to Ahab. The king saw in him a prophet who fearlessly
opposed all the idolatrous tendencies into which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
he had led his easy and faithless people. How terribly
must Ahab's hatred have been now intensified!
We see from all the books of the prophets that they
were personally identified with their predictions; that
they were held responsible for them, were even regarded
in popular apprehension as having actually brought
about the things which they predicted. "See," says
Jehovah to the timid boy Jeremiah, "I have this day
set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms to
root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw
down, to build, and to plant." The Prophet is addressed
as though he personally effected the ruin he denounced.
Elijah, then, would be regarded by Ahab as in one sense
the author of the three years' famine. It would be
held&mdash;not indeed with perfect accuracy, yet with a not
unnatural confusion&mdash;that it was <i>he</i> who had shut up
the windows of heaven and caused the misery and
starvation of the suffering multitudes. With what
wrath would a great and powerful king like Ahab look
on this bold intruder, this skin-clad alien of Gilead,
who had frustrated his policy, defied his power, and
stamped his reign with so overwhelming a disaster.
Yet he is bidden, "Go, show thyself unto Ahab"; and
perhaps his immediate safety was only secured by the
additional message, "and I will send rain upon the
earth."</p>

<p>Things had, indeed, come to their worst. The "sore
famine" in Samaria had reached a point which, if it
had not been alleviated, would have led to the utter
ruin of the miserable kingdom.</p>

<p>In this crisis Ahab did all that a king could do.
Most of the cattle had perished, but it was essential
to save if possible some of the horses and mules. No
grass was left on the scorched plains and bare brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
hills except where there were fountains and brooks
which had not entirely vanished under that copper
sky. To these places it was necessary to drive such
a remnant of the cattle as it might be still possible
to preserve alive. But who could be trusted to rise
entirely superior to individual selfishness in such a
search? Ahab thought it best to trust no one but
himself and his vizier Obadiah. The very name of
this high official, Obadjahu, like the common Mohammedan
names Abdallah, Abderrahnan, and others,
implied that he was "a servant of Jehovah." His conduct
answered to his name, for on Jezebel's persecuting
attempt to exterminate Jehovah's prophets in their
schools or communities, he, "the Sebastian of the
Jewish Diocletian," had, at the peril of his own life,
taken a hundred of them, concealed them in two of the
great limestone caves of Palestine&mdash;perhaps in the
recesses of Mount Carmel,<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> and fed them with bread
and water. It is to Ahab's credit that he retained such
a man in office, though the touch of timidity which we
trace in Obadiah may have concealed the full faithfulness
of his personal allegiance to the old worship.
Yet that such a man should still hold the post of
chamberlain (<i>al-hab-baith</i>) furnishes a fresh proof that
Ahab was not himself a worshipper of Baal.</p>

<p>The king and his vizier went in opposite directions,
each of them unaccompanied, and Obadiah was on his
way when he was startled by the sudden appearance of
Elijah. He had not previously seen him, but recognising
him by his shaggy locks, his robe of skin, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
the awful sternness of his swarthy countenance, he was
almost abjectly terrified. Apart from the awe-inspiring
aspect and manner of the Prophet, this seemed no mere
man who stood before him, but the representative of the
Eternal, and the wielder of His power. To his contemporaries
he appeared like the incarnate vengeance
of Jehovah against guilty times, a flash as it were of
God's consuming fire. To the Moslim of to-day he
is still <i>El Khudr</i>, "the eternal wanderer." Springing
from his chariot, Obadiah fell flat on his face and cried,
"Is it thou, my lord Elijah?" "It is I," answered the
Prophet, not wasting words over his terror and astonishment.
"Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here."</p>

<p>The message enhanced the vizier's alarm. Why
had not Elijah showed himself at once to Ahab? Did
some terrible vindictive purpose lurk behind his message?
Did Elijah confuse the aims and deeds of the
minister with those of the king? Why did he despatch
him on an errand which might move Ahab to kill him?
Was not Elijah aware, he asks, with Eastern hyperbole,
that Ahab had sent "to every nation and kingdom" to
ask if Elijah was there, and when told that he was not
there he made them confirm the statement by an oath?<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>
What would come of such a message if Obadiah conveyed
it? No sooner would it be delivered than the
wind of the Lord would sweep Elijah away into some
new and unknown solitude,<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> and Ahab, thinking that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
he had only been befooled, would in his angry disappointment,
put Obadiah to death. Had he deserved
such a fate? Had not Elijah heard of his reverence
for Jehovah from his youth, and of his saving the
hundred prophets at the peril of his life? Why then
send him on so dangerous a mission? To these
agitated appeals Elijah answered by his customary
oath, "As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand,<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>
I will show myself unto him to-day." Then Obadiah
went and told Ahab, and Ahab with impetuous haste
hastened to meet Elijah, knowing that on him depended
the fate of his kingdom.</p>

<p>Yet when they met he could not check the burst of
anger which sprang to his lips.</p>

<p>"Is it thou, thou troubler of Israel?" he fiercely
exclaimed.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> Elijah was not the man to quail before the
<i>vultus instantis tyranni</i>. "I have not troubled Israel,"
was the undaunted answer, "but thou and thy father's
house." The cause of the drought was not the menace
of Elijah, but the apostasy to Baalim. It was time that
the fatal controversy should be decided. There must
be an appeal to the people. Elijah was in a position
to dictate, and he did dictate. "Let all Israel," he said,
"be summoned to Mount Carmel;" and there he would
singly meet in their presence the four hundred and fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
prophets of Baal, and the four hundred prophets of the
Asherah, all of whom ate at Jezebel's table.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> Then
and there a great challenge should take place, and the
question should be settled for ever, whether Baal or
Jehovah was to be the national god of Israel. What
challenge could be fairer, seeing that Baal was the
Sun-god, the god of fire?</p>

<p>It never occurred to Ahab to refuse the challenge,
or to arrest the hated messenger. The hermit and
the dervish are sacrosanct; they stand before kings
and are not ashamed. Having nothing to desire,
they have nothing to fear. So Antony stalked into
the streets of Alexandria to denounce its prefect; so
Athanasius fearlessly seized the bridle of Constantine
in his new city; so a ragged and dwarfish old man&mdash;Macedonius
the Barley-eater&mdash;descended from his
mountain cave at Antioch to stop the horses of the
avenging commissioners of Thedosius, and bade them
go back and rebuke the fury of their Emperor,&mdash;and
so far from punishing him they alighted, and fell on
their knees, and begged his blessing.</p>

<p>The vast assembly was gathered by royal proclamation.
There could have been no scene in the land
of Israel more strikingly suitable for the purpose than
Mount Carmel. It is a ridge of upper oolite, or Jura
limestone, which at the eastern extremity rises more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
than sixteen hundred feet above the sea, sinking
down to six hundred feet at the western extremity.
The "excellency of Carmel" of which the prophet
speaks<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> consists in the fruitfulness which to this day
makes it rich in flowers of all hues, and clothes it with
the impenetrable foliage of oak, pine, walnut, olive,
laurel, dense brushwood, and evergreen shrubberies
thicker than in any other part in Central Palestine.
The name means "Garden of God," and travellers,
delighted with the rocky dells and blossoming glades,
describe Carmel as "still the fragrant lovely mountain
that it was of old."<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> It "forms the southern extremity
of the Gulf of Khaifa, and separates the great western
plain of Philistia from the plain of Esdraelon, and the
plain of Ph&#339;nicia." "It is difficult," says Sir G.
Grove, "to find another site in which every particular
is so minutely fulfilled as in this." The whole mountain
is now called <i>Mar Elias</i> from the Prophet's name.</p>

<p>The actual spot of the range near which took place
this most memorable event in the history of Israel was
almost undoubtedly a little below the eastern summit of
the ridge. It is "a terrace of natural rock," which commands
a fine view of the plains and lakes and the hills
of Galilee, and the windings of the Kishon, with Jezreel
glimmering in the far distance under the heights of
Gilboa. The remains of an old and massive square
structure are here visible, called <i>El-Muhrakkah</i>, "the
burning," or "the sacrifice," perhaps the site of Elijah's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
altar. Under the ancient olives still remains the round
well of perennial water from which, even in the
drought, the Prophet could fill the barrels which he
poured over his sacrifice. Elijah's grotto is pointed out
in the Church of the Convent, and another near the
sea. In the region known as "the garden of Elijah"
are found the <i>geodes</i> and <i>septaria</i>&mdash;stones and fossils
which assume the aspect, sometimes of loaves of bread,
sometimes of water-melons and olives, and are still
known as "Elijah's fruits." The whole mountain murmurs
with his name.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> He became in local legend the
oracular god Carmelus, whose "altar and devotion"
drew visitors no less illustrious than Pythagoras and
Vespasian to visit the sacred hill.<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a></p>

<p>Here, then, at early dawn the Prophet of Jehovah,
in his solitary grandeur, met the four hundred and fifty
idolatrous priests and their rabble of attendant fanatics
in the presence of the half-curious king and the half-apostate
people. He presented the oft-repeated type
of God's servant alone against the world.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> Most rarely
is it otherwise. They who speak smooth things and
prophesy deceits may always live at ease in amicable
compromise with the world, the flesh, and the devil.
But the Prophet has ever to set his face as a flint
against tyrants, and mobs and false prophets, and
intriguing priests, and all who daub tottering walls
with untempered mortar, and all who, in days smooth
and perilous, softly murmur, "Peace, peace, when there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
is no peace." So it was with Noah in the days of the
deluge; so with Amos and Hosea and the later Zechariah;
so with Micaiah, the son of Imlah; so with
Isaiah, mocked as a babbler by the priests at Jerusalem,
and at last sawn asunder; so with Jeremiah, struck in
the face by the priest Pashur, and thrust into the miry
dungeon, and at last murdered in exile; so with
Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, whom they slew between
the porch and the altar. Nor has it been less so since
the earliest dawn of the New Dispensation. Of John
the Baptist the priests and Pharisees said, "He has a
devil," and Herod slew him in prison. All, perhaps,
of the twelve Apostles were martyred. Paul, like the
rest, was intrigued against, thwarted, hated, mobbed,
imprisoned, hunted from place to place by the world,
the Jews, and the false Christians. Treated as the
offscouring of all things, he was at last contemptuously
beheaded in utter obscurity. Similar fates
befell many of the best and greatest of the Fathers.
Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin, were slain by wild beasts
and by fire. Origen's life was one long martyrdom,
mostly at the hands of his fellow-Christians. Did not
Athanasius stand against the world? What needs it to
summon from the prison or the stake the mighty shades
of Savonarola, of Huss, of Jerome of Prague, of the
Albigenses and Waldenses, of the myriad victims of the
Inquisition, of those who were burnt at Smithfield and
Oxford, of Luther, of Whitfield? Did Christ mean
nothing when he said, among His first beatitudes,
"Blessed are ye when all men shall revile you, and
persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you
falsely for My sake and the gospel's"? Was it mere
accident and metaphor when He said, "Ye are of the
world, and therefore the world cannot hate you; but Me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
it hateth"; and, "If they have called the Master of the
house Beelzebub, much more them of His household"?
Which of His best and purest sons, from the first Good
Friday down to this day, has ever passed through life
unpersecuted of slanderous tongues? Has the nominal
Church ever shown any more mercy to saints than the
sneering and furious world? What has sustained
Christ's hated ones? What but that confidence towards
God which lives among those whose heart condemns
them not? What but the fact that "they could turn from
the storm without to the approving sunshine within"?
"See," it has been said, "he who builds on the
general esteem of the world builds, not on the sand, but,
which is worse, upon the wind, and writes the title-deeds
of his hope upon the face of a river." But when a man
knows that "one with God is always in a majority," then
his loneliness is changed into the confidence that all the
ten thousand times ten thousand of Heaven are with
him. "His banishment becomes his preferment, his
rags his trophies, his nakedness his ornament; and,
so long as his innocence is his repast, he feasts and
banquets upon bread and water."</p>

<p>And so,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Among the faithless, faithful only he;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Among innumerable false, unmoved,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Elijah fearlessly stood alone, while all the world confronted
him with frowning menace. The coward sympathies
of the neutrals who face both ways may have
been with him, but the multitude of such Laodiceans
wink at wrong, and from love of their own ease do not,
and dare not, speak. God only was the protector of
Elijah, and in himself alone was all his state, as in his
garment of hair he approached the people and confronted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
the idolatrous priests in all the gorgeousness
of Baal's vestry. He, like his great predecessor Moses,
was the champion of moral purity, of the national faith,
of religious freedom and simplicity, of the immediate
access of man to God; they were the champions of
fanatical and unhallowed religionism, of usurping priestcraft,
of unnatural self-abasements, of persecuting
despotism, of licentious and cruel rites. Elijah was
the deliverer of his people from a hideous and polluted
apostasy which, had he not prevailed that day, would
have obliterated their name and their memory from the
annals of the nations. That he was a genuine historic
character&mdash;a prophet of Divine commission and marvellous
power&mdash;cannot for a moment be doubted, however
impossible it may now be in every incident to
disentangle the literal historic facts from the poetic
and legendary emblazonment which those facts not
unnaturally received in the ordinary recollection of the
prophetic schools. Throughout the great scene which
followed, his spirit was that of the Psalmist: "Though
an host of men should encamp against me, yet will
not my heart be afraid"; that of the "servant of the
Lord" in Isaiah: "He hath made my mouth like a
sharp sword, and in His quiver hath He hid me."<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></p>

<p>His first challenge was to the people. "How long,"
he asked, "do ye totter between two opinions?<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> If
Jehovah be God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span></p>
<p>Awestruck and ashamed the multitude kept unbroken
silence. Doubtless it was, in part, the silence of guilt.
They knew that they had followed Jezebel into the
cruelties of Baal-worship, and the forbidden lusts which
polluted the temples of the Asherah. Puritanism
simplicity, spirituality of worship involves a strain
too great and too lofty for the multitude. Like all
Orientals, like the negroes of America, like most weak
minds, they loved to rely on a pompous ritual and a
sensuous worship. It is so easy to let these stand
for the deeper requirements which lie in the truth that
"God is a Spirit, and they that worship Him must
worship Him in spirit and in truth."</p>

<p>Receiving no answer to his stern question, Elijah
laid down the conditions of the contest. "The prophets
of Baal," he said, "are four hundred and fifty: I stand
alone as a prophet of Jehovah. Let two bullocks be
provided for us; they shall slay and dress one, and lay
it on wood, but&mdash;for there shall be no priestly trickeries
to-day&mdash;they shall put no fire under. I, though I be
no priest, will slay and dress the other, and lay it on
wood, and put no fire under. Then let all of you, Baal-priests
and people if you will, cry to your idols; I will
call on the name of Jehovah. The god that answereth
by fire let <i>him</i> be God."</p>

<p>No challenge could be fairer, for Baal was the Sun-god;
and what god could be more likely to answer by
fire from that blazing sky? The deep murmur of the
people expressed their assent. The Baal priests were
caught as in a snare. Their hearts must have sunk
within them; his did not. Perhaps some of them
believed sufficiently in their idol to hope that, were
he demon or deity, he might save himself and his
votaries from humiliation and defeat; but most of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
must have been seized with terrible misgiving, as they
saw the assembled people prepared to wait with
Oriental patience, seated on their abbas on the sides
of that natural amphitheatre, till the descending flame
should prove that Baal had heard the weird invocation
of his worshippers. But, since they could not escape
the proposed ordeal, they chose, and slew, and dressed
their victim. From morning till noon&mdash;many of them
with wildly waving arms, others with their foreheads in
the dust&mdash;they upraised the wild chant of their monotonous
invocation, "Baal, hear us! Baal, hear us!" In
vain the cry rose and fell, now uttered in soft appealing
murmurs, now rising into passionate entreaties. All
was silent. There lay the dead bullock putrescing
under the burning orb which was at once their deity
and the visible sign of his presence. No consuming
lightning fell, even when the sun flamed in the zenith
of that cloudless sky. There was no voice nor any that
answered.</p>

<p>Then they tried still more potent incantations. They
began to circle round the altar they had made in one of
their solemn dances to the shrill strains of pipe and
flute. The rhythmic movements ended in giddy whirls
and orgiastic leapings which were a common feature
of sensuous heathen worship; dances in which, like
modern dervishes, they bounded and yelled and spun
round and round till they fell foaming and senseless to
the ground.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> The people looked on expectant, but it
was all in vain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>
<p>Hitherto the Prophet had remained silent, but now
when noon came, and still no fire descended, he mocked
them. Now, surely, if ever, was their time! They had
been crying for six long hours in their vain repetitions
and incantations. Surely they had not shouted loud
enough! Baal was a god; some strange accident must
have prevented him from hearing the prayer of his
miserable priests. Perhaps he was in deep meditation,
so that he did not notice those frantic appeals; perhaps
he was too busy talking to some one else,<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> or was on a
journey somewhere; or was asleep and must be awaked;
or, he added with yet more mordant sarcasm, and in a
gibe which would have sounded coarse to modern ears,
perhaps he has gone aside for a private purpose. He
must be called, he must be aroused; he must be made
to hear.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a></p>

<p>Such taunts, addressed to this multitude of priests in
the hearing of the people, whom they desired to dupe
or to convince, drove them to fiercer frenzy. Already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
the westering sun began to warn them that their hour
was past, and failure imminent. They would not
succumb without trying the darker sorceries of blood
and self-mutilation, which were only resorted to at the
most dread extremities. With renewed and redoubled
yells they offered on their altar the blood of human
sacrifice, stabbing and gashing themselves with swords
and lances, till they presented a horrid spectacle.
Their vestments and their naked bodies were besmeared
with gore<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> as they whirled round and round with
shriller and more frenzied screams.<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> They raved in
vain. The shadows began to lengthen. The hour for
the evening <i>Minchah</i>, the evening meal-offering, and
oblation of flour and meal, salt and frankincense, drew
near.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> It was already "between the two evenings."
They had continued their weird invocations all through
the burning day, but there was not any that regarded.
There lay the dead bullock on the still fireless altar;
and now their Tyrian Sun-god, like the fabled
"Hercules," was but burning himself to death on the
flaming pyre of sunset amid the unavailing agony of
his worshippers.</p>

<p>Then Elijah bade the sullen and baffled fanatics to
stand aside, and summoned the people to throng round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
him. There was nothing tumultuous or orgiastic in
his proceedings. In striking contrast with the four
hundred and fifty frantic sun-worshippers, he proceeded
in the calmest and most deliberate way. First, in the
name of Jehovah, he repaired the old <i>bamah</i>&mdash;the mountain-altar,
which probably Jezebel had broken down.
This he did with twelve stones, one for each of the
tribes of Israel. Then he dug a broad trench.<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> Then,
when he had prepared his bullock, in order to show the
people the impossibility of any deception, such as are
common among priests, he bade them drench it three
times over with four barrels of water,<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> from the still-existent
spring, and, not content with that, he filled the
trench also with water.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> Lastly at the time of the
evening oblation he briefly offered up one prayer that
Jehovah would make it known this day to His backsliding
people that He, not Baal, was the Elohim of
Israel. He used no "much speaking"; he did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
adopt the dervish yells and dances and gashings which
were abhorrent to God, though they appealed so powerfully
to the sensuous imaginations of the multitude.
He only raised his eyes to heaven,<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> and cried aloud in
the hush of expectant stillness:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Jehovah, God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Let it be known this day that Thou art God in Israel,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And that I am Thy servant,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And that I have done all these things at Thy word.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hear me, Jehovah, hear me.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That this people may know that Thou, Jehovah, art God,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And that Thou hast turned their heart back again."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The prayer, with its triple invocation of Jehovah's
name, and its seven rhythmic lines, was no sooner
ended than down streamed the lightning, and consumed
the bullock and the wood, and shattered the stones,
and burnt up the dust, and licked up the water in the
trenches;<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> and, with one terror-stricken impulse, the
people all prostrated themselves on their faces with the
cry, "<i>Yahweh&mdash;hoo&mdash;ha&mdash;Elohim, Yahweh&mdash;hoo&mdash;ha&mdash;Elohim!</i>"
"The Lord, He is God; the Lord, He is
God!"&mdash;a cry which was almost identical with the
name of the victorious prophet Elijahu&mdash;"Yah, He is
my God."<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a></p>

<p>The magnificent narrative in which the interest has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
been wound up to so high a pitch, and expressed in so
lofty a strain of imaginative and dramatic force, ends in
a deed of blood. According to Josephus, the people, by
a spontaneous movement, "seized and slew the prophets
of Baal, Elijah exhorting them to do so." According
to the earlier narrative, Elijah said to the people:
"Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them
escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them
down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there with
the sword."<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> It is not necessarily meant that he slew
them with his own hand, though indeed he may have
done so, as Phinehas sacrificed Jephthah's daughter,
and Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord.
His moral responsibility was precisely the same in
either case. We are not told that he had any commission
from Jehovah to do this, or was bidden thereto
by any voice of the Lord. Yet in those wild days&mdash;days
of ungovernable passions and imperfect laws, days
of ignorance which God winked at&mdash;it is not only
perfectly probable that Elijah would have acted thus,
but most unlikely that his conscience reproached him
for doing so, or that it otherwise than approved the
sanguinary vengeance. It was the frightful <i>lex talionis</i>,
which was spoken "to them of old time," and which
inflicted on the defeated what they would certainly
have inflicted on Elijah had he not been the conqueror.
The prophets of Baal indirectly, if not directly, had
been the cause of Jezebel's persecution of the prophets
of the Lord. The thought of pity would not occur to
Elijah any more than it did to the writer, or writers,
of Deuteronomy, perhaps, long afterwards, who commanded
the stoning of idolaters, whether men or women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
(Deut. xiii. 6-9, xvii. 2-4). The massacre of the priests
accorded with the whole spirit of those half-anarchic
times. It accords with that Elijah-spirit of orthodox
fanaticism, which, as Christ Himself had to teach to the
sons of thunder, is not His spirit, but utterly alien from
it. If, perhaps two centuries later, the savage deed
could be recorded, and recorded with approval, by this
narrator from the School of the Prophets in these superb
eulogies of his hero; if so many centuries later the
disciple whom Jesus loved, and the first martyr-apostle
could deem it an exemplary deed; if, centuries later,
it could be appealed to as a precedent by Inquisitors
with hearts made hard as the nether millstone by
bigoted and hateful superstition; if even Puritans
could be animated by the same false hallowing of
ferocity; how can we judge Elijah if, in dark, unilluminated
early days, he had not learnt to rise to a purer
standpoint? To this day the names about Carmel
shudder, as it were, with reminiscence of this religious
massacre. There is <i>El-Muhrakkah</i>, "the place of
burning"; there is <i>Tel-el-Kusis</i>, "the hill of the
priests"; and that ancient river, the river Kishon,
which had once been choked with the corpses of the
host of Sisera, and has since then been incarnadined
by the slain of many a battle, is&mdash;perhaps in memory
of this bloodshed most of all&mdash;still known as the <i>Nahr-el-Mokatta</i>,
or "the stream of slaughter." What wonder
that the Eastern Christians in their pictures of Elijah
still surround him with the decapitated heads of these
his enemies? To this day the Moslim regard him as
one who terrifies and slays.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a></p>

<p>But though the deed of vengeance stands recorded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
and recorded with no censure, in the sacred history,
we must&mdash;without condemning Elijah, and without
measuring his days by the meting-rod of Christian
mercy&mdash;still unhesitatingly hold fast the sound principle
of early and as yet uncontaminated Christianity,
and say, as said the early Fathers, &#914;&#8055;&#945; &#7952;&#967;&#952;&#961;&#8056;&#957; &#920;&#949;&#8183;.
Violence is a thing hateful to the God of love.</p>

<p>Even Christians, and that down to our own day,
have abused the example of Elijah, and asked, "Did
not Elijah slaughter the priests of Baal?" as a proof
that it is always the duty of States to suppress false
religion by violence. Stahl asked that question when
he preached before the Prussian court at the Evangelical
Conference at Berlin in 1855, adding the dreadful
misrepresentation that "Christianity is the religion of
intolerance, and its kernel is exclusiveness." Did these
hard spirits never consider Christ's own warning? Did
they wholly forget the prophecy that "He shall not
strive nor cry, neither shall His voice be heard in the
streets. A bruised reed shall He not break, and
smoking flax shall He not quench, till He send forth
judgment unto victory, and in His name shall the
Gentiles hope"?<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> Calvin reproved Réné, Duchess of
Ferrara, for not approving of the spirit of the imprecatory
psalms. He said that this was "to set ourselves
up as superior to Christ in sweetness and humility";
and that "David even in his hatreds is an example and
type of Christ." When Cartwright argued for the
execution of the heretics he said: "If this be thought
savage and intolerant, I am content to be so with the
Holy Ghost." Far wiser is the humble minister in
<i>Old Mortality</i>, when he withstood Balfour of Burleigh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
in the decision to put to the sword all the inhabitants
of Tillietudlem Castle. "By what law," asks Henry
Morton, "would you justify the atrocity you would
commit?" "If thou art ignorant of it," said Balfour,
"thy companion is well aware of the law which gave
the men of Jericho to the sword of Joshua, the son of
Nun." "Yes," answered the divine, "but we live
under a better dispensation, which instructeth us to
return good for evil, and to pray for those who
despitefully use us and persecute us."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE RAIN.</i></h3>

<p class="center">1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> xviii. 41-46.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Are there any of the vanities of the nations that can cause rain?"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jer.</span>
xiv. 22.</p></blockquote>


<p>But the terrible excitement of the day was not yet
over, nor was the victory completely won. The
fire had flashed from heaven, but the long-desired rain
on which depended the salvation of land and people
still showed no signs of falling. And Elijah was
pledged to this result. Not until the drought ended
could he reach the culmination of his victory over the
Sun-god of Jezebel's worship.</p>

<p>But his faith did not fail him. "Get thee up," he
said to Ahab, "eat and drink, for there is a sound of
the feet of the rain-storm."<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> Doubtless through all
that day of feverish anxiety, neither king, nor people,
nor prophet had eaten. As for the Prophet, but little
sufficed him at any time, and the slaughter of the
defeated priests would not prevent either king or people
from breaking their long fast. Doubtless the king's
tent was pitched on one of the slopes over the plain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
But Elijah did not join him. He heard, indeed, with
prophetic ear the rush of the coming rain, but he had
still to wrestle in prayer with Jehovah for the fulfilment
of His promise. So he ascended towards the summit
of the promontory where the purple peak of Carmel&mdash;still
called Jebel Mar Elias ("the hill of Lord Elijah")&mdash;overlooks
the sea, and there he crouched low on the
ground in intense prayer, putting his face between his
knees. After his first intensity of supplication had
spent itself, he said to his boy attendant,<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> traditionally
believed to have been the son of the widow of Zarephath
whom he had plucked from death:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go up now, look towards the sea."</p>

<p>The youth went up, and gazed out long and intently,
for he well knew that if rain came it would sweep
inland from the waters of the Mediterranean, and to an
experienced eye the signals of coming storm are patent
long before they are noticed by others. But all was as
it had been for so many weary and dreadful months.
The sea a sheet of unruffled gold glared under the
setting sun, which still sank through an unclouded
sky. Can we not imagine the accent of misgiving and
disappointment with which he brought back the one
word:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>Once more the Prophet bowed his face between his
knees in prayer, and sent the youth; and again, and
yet again, seven times. And each time had come to
him the chilling answer, "Nothing." But the seventh
time he called out from the mountain summit his joyous
cry: "Behold, there ariseth a cloud out of the sea, as
small as a man's hand."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span></p>
<p>And now, indeed, Elijah knew that his triumph was
completed. He bade his servant fly with winged speed
to Ahab, and tell him to make ready his chariot at once,
lest the burst of the coming rain should flood the river
and the road, and prevent him from getting over the
rough ground which lay between him and his palace
at Jezreel.</p>

<p>Then the blessed storm burst on the parched soil with
a sense of infinite refreshfulness which only an Eastern
in a thirsty land can fully comprehend. And Ahab
mounted his chariot. He had not driven far before
the heaven, which had for so long been like brass over
an iron globe, was one black mass of clouds driven by
the wind, and the drenching rain poured down in sheets.
And through the storm the chariot swept, and Elijah
girded up his loins, and, filled with a Divine impulse of
exultation, ran before it, keeping pace with the king's
steeds for all those fifteen miles, even after the overwhelming
strain of all he had gone through, apparently
without food, that day. And as through the rifts of
rain the king saw his wild dark figure outrunning his
swift steeds, and seeming "to dilate and conspire" with
the rushing storm, can we wonder that the tears of
remorse and gratitude streamed down his face?<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<p>The chariot reached Jezreel, and at the city gate
Elijah stopped. Like his antitype, the great forerunner,
Elijah was a voice in the wilderness; like his Lord
that was to be, he loved not cities. The instinct of the
Bedawin kept him far from the abodes of men, and his
home was never among them. He needed no roof to
shelter him, nor change of raiment. The hollows of
Mount Gilboa were his sufficient resting-place, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
could find a sleeping-place in the caves near its abundant
Eastern spring. Nor was he secure of safety. He
knew, in spite of his superhuman victory, that a dark
hour awaited Ahab when he would have to tell Jezebel
that the people had repudiated her idol, and that Elijah
had slain her four hundred and fifty priests. He knew
"that axe-like edge unturnable" which always smote
and feared not. Ahab was but as plastic clay in the
strong hands of his queen, and for her there existed
neither mystery nor miracle except in the worship of the
insulted Baal. Was not Baal, she said, the real sender
of the rain, on whose priests this fanatic from rude
Gilead had wrought his dreadful sacrifice? Oh that she
could have been for one hour on Carmel in the place of
her vacillating and easily daunted husband! For was
she not convinced, and did not the pagan historian
afterwards relate, that the ending of the drought was
due to the prayers and sacrifices, not of Elijah, but of
her own father who was Baal's priest and king?<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> Yet,
for all her spirit of defiance, we can hardly doubt that
the feelings of Jezebel towards Elijah had much of
dread mingled with her hatred. She must have felt
towards him much as Mary Queen of Scots felt towards
John Knox&mdash;of whom she said that she feared his
prayers more than an army of one hundred thousand
men.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></p>

<p>"May we really venture," asks Canon Cheyne, "to
<i>look</i> out for answer to prayer? Did not Elijah live
in the <i>heroic</i> ages of faith? No; God still works
miracles. Take an instance from the early history
of Christian Europe. You know the terror excited by
the Huns, who in the sixth century after Christ penetrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
into the very heart of Christian France. Already
they had occupied the suburbs of Orleans, and the
people who were incapable of bearing arms lay prostrate
in prayer. The governor sent a message to observe
from the ramparts. Twice he looked in vain, but the
third time he reported a small cloud on the horizon.
'It is the aid of God,' cried the Bishop of Orleans.
It was the dust raised by the advancing squadrons of
Christian troops."<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a></p>

<p>A much nearer parallel, and that a very remarkable
one, may be quoted.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> It records&mdash;and the fact itself,
explain it how men will, seems to be unquestionable&mdash;how
a storm of rain came to answer the prayer of a good
leader of the Evangelical Revival&mdash;Grimshaw, rector
of Haworth. Distressed at the horrible immoralities
introduced among his parishioners by some local races,
and wholly failing to get them stopped, he went to the
racecourse, and, flinging himself on his knees in an
agony of supplication, entreated God to interpose and
save his people from their moral danger. He had
scarcely ceased his prayer when down rushed a storm
of rain so violent as to turn the racecourse into a
swamp, and render the projected races a matter of
impossibility.</p>

<p>The misgiving which, joined to his ascetic dislike
of cities, made Elijah stop his swift race at the
entrance of Jezreel was more than justified. Ahab's
narrative of the splendid contest at Carmel produced no
effect upon Jezebel whatever, and we can imagine the
bitter objurgations which she poured upon her cowering
husband for having stood quietly by while <i>her</i> prophets
and Baal's prophets were being massacred by this dark
fanatic, aided by a rebellious people. Had <i>she</i> been
there all should have been otherwise! In contemptuous
defiance of Ahab's fears or wishes, she then and there&mdash;and
it must now have been after nightfall&mdash;despatched
a messenger to find Elijah, wherever he might be
hiding himself, and say to him in her name: "As sure
as thou art Elijah, and I am Jezebel,<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> may my gods
avenge it upon me if on the morrow by this time I
have not made thy life like the life of one of my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
murdered priests." In the furious impetuosity of the
message we see the determination of the sorceress-queen.
In her way she was as much in deadly earnest
as Elijah was. Whether Baal had been defeated or
not, <i>she</i> was not defeated, and Elijah should not escape
her vengeance. The oath shows the intensity of her
rage, like that of the forty Jews who bound themselves
by the <i>cherem</i> that they would not eat or drink till
they had slain Paul; and the fixity of her purpose
as when Richard III. declared that he would not dine
till the head of Buckingham had fallen on the block.
We cannot but notice the insignificance to which she
reduced her husband, and the contempt with which
she treated the voice of her people. She presents the
spectacle, so often reproduced in history and reflected
in literature, of a strong fierce woman&mdash;a Clytemnestra,
a Brunhault, a Lady Macbeth, an Isabella of France, a
Margaret of Anjou, a Joan of Naples, a Catherine de
Medicis&mdash;completely dominating a feebler consort.</p>

<p>The burst of rage which led her to send the message
defeated her own object. The awfulness which invested
Elijah, and the supernatural powers on which he relied,
when he was engaged in the battles of the Lord,
belonged to him only in his public and prophetic
capacity. As a man he was but a poor, feeble, lonely
subject, whose blood might be shed at any moment.
He knew that God works no miracles for the supersession
of ordinary human precautions. It was no part
of his duty to throw away his life, and give a counter
triumph to the Baal-worshippers whom he had so
signally humiliated. He fled, and went for his life.</p>

<p>Swift flight was easy to that hardy frame and that
trained endurance, even after the fearful day on Carmel
and the wild race of fifteen miles from Carmel to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
Jezreel. It was still night, and cool, and the haunts
and byways of the land were known to the solitary and
hunted wanderer. "He feared, and he rose, and he
went for his life," ninety-five miles to Beersheba, once
a town of Simeon, now the southern limit of the kingdom
of Judah, thirty-one miles south of Hebron.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> But
in the tumult of his feelings and the peril of his position
he could not stay in any town. At Beersheba he left
his servant&mdash;perhaps, as legend says, the boy of
Zarephath, who became the prophet Jonah&mdash;but, in any
case, not so much a servant as a youth in training for
the prophetic office. It was necessary for him to spend
his dark hour alone; for, if there are hours in which
human sympathy is all but indispensable, there are also
hours in which the soul can tolerate no communion save
that with God.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> So, leaving all civilisation behind him,
he plunged a day's journey into that great and terrible
wilderness of Paran, where he too was alone with the
wild beasts. And then, utterly worn out, he flung
himself down under the woody stem of a solitary
rhotem plant.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> The plant is the wild broom with "its
cloud of pink blossoms" which often afford the only
shadow under the glaring sun in the waste and weary
land, and beneath the slight but grateful shade of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
the Arab to this day is glad to pitch his tent. And
there the pent-up emotions of his spirit, which had gone
through so tremendous a strain, broke up as in one
terrible sob, when the strong man, like a tired child,
"requested for himself that he might die."<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></p>

<p>Of what use was life any longer? He had fought
for Jehovah, and won, and after all been humiliatingly
defeated. He had prophesied the drought, and it had
withered and scorched up the erring, afflicted land. He
had prayed for the rain, and it had come in a rush of
blessing on the reviving fields. In the Wady Cherith,
in the house of the Ph&#339;nician widow, he had been
divinely supported and sheltered from hot pursuit. He
had snatched her boy from death. He had stood before
kings, and not been ashamed. He had stretched forth
his hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people, and
not in vain. He had confounded the rich-vested and
royally maintained band of Baal's priests, and in spite
of their orgiastic leapings and self-mutilations had put
to shame their Sun-god under his own burning sun.
He had kept pace with Ahab's chariot-steeds as he conducted
him, as it were in triumph, through the streaming
downpour of that sweeping storm, to his summer capital.
Of what use was it all? Was it anything but a splendid
and deplorable failure? And he said: "It is enough;
now, O Lord, take away my life; for I am not better
than my fathers." He could have cried with the poet:&mdash;</p>

<p>Who does not know something of this feeling of utter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
overwhelming despondency, of bitter disillusionment
concerning life and our fellow-men? Some great
writer has said, with truth, "that there is probably no
man with a soul above that of the brutes that perish,
to whom a time has not come in his life, when, were
you to tell him that he would not wake to see another
day, he would receive the message with something like
gladness." There are some whose lives have been so
saddened by some special calamity that for long years
together they have not valued them. F. W. Robertson,
troubled by various sorrows, and worried (as the best
men are sure to be) by the petty ecclesiastical persecutions
of priests and formalists, wrote in a letter on a
friend's death: "How often have I thought of the
evening when he left Tours, when, in our boyish
friendship, we set our little silver watches exactly
together, and made a compact to look at the moon
exactly at the same moment that night and think of
each other. <i>I do not remember a single hour in life
since then which I would have arrested, and said, 'Let
this stay.'</i>" Melancholy so deep as this is morbid and
unnatural, and he himself wrote in a brighter mood:
"Positively I will not walk with any one in these
tenebrous avenues of cypress and yew. I like sunny
rooms and sunny truth. When I had more of spring
and warmth I could afford to be prodigal of happiness;
but now I want sunlight and sunshine. I desire to
enter into those regions where cheerfulness and truth
and health of heart and mind reside." Life has its
real happiness for those who have deserved, and taken
the right method to attain it; but it can never escape
its hours of impenetrable gloom, and they sometimes
seem to be darkest for the noblest souls. Petty souls
are irritated by little annoyances, and the purely selfish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
disappointments which avenge the exaggerated claims
of our "shivering egotism." But while little mean
spirits are tormented by the insect-swarm of little mean
worries, great souls are liable to be beaten down by
the waves and storms of immense calamities&mdash;the calamities
which affect nations and churches, the "desperate
currents" of whose sins and miseries seem to be sometimes
driven through the channels of their single hearts.
Only such a man as an Elijah can measure the colossal
despondency of an Elijah's heart. In the apparently
absolute failure, the seemingly final frustration of such
men as these there is something nobler than in the
highest personal exaltations of ignobler souls.</p>

<p>"<i>Now, O Lord, take away my life!</i>" The prayer,
however natural, however excusable, is never right. It
is a sign of insufficient faith, of human imperfection;
but it is breathed by different persons in a spirit so
different that in some it almost rises to nobleness, as
in others it sinks quite beneath contempt.</p>

<p>Scripture gives us several specimens of both moods.
If Jonah was, indeed, the servant-pupil of Elijah, the
legendary story of that meanest-minded of all the
prophets&mdash;the meanest-minded and paltriest, not perhaps
as he was in reality&mdash;for of him, historically, we know
scarcely anything&mdash;but as he is represented in the profound
and noble allegory which bears his name&mdash;might
almost seem to have been written in tacit antithesis to
the story of Elijah. Elijah flies only when he has done
the mighty work of God, and only when the life is
in deadly peril which he would fain save for future
emergencies of service; Jonah flies that he may escape,
out of timid selfishness, the work of God. Elijah wishes
himself dead because he thinks that the glorious purpose
of his life has been thwarted, and that the effort undertaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
for the deliverance of his people has failed; Jonah
wishes himself dead, first, because he repines at God's
mercy, and would prefer that his personal credit should
be saved and his personal importance secured than
that God should spare the mighty city of Nineveh with
its one hundred and twenty thousand little children;
and then because the poor little castor-oil plant has
withered, which gave him shelter from the noon. Considering
the traditional connexion between them, it
seems to me impossible to overlook an allusive contrast
between the noble and mighty Elijah under his solitary
rhotem plant in the wilderness wishing for death in
the anguish of a heart "which nobly loathing strongly
broke," and the selfish splenetic Jonah wishing himself
dead in pettish vexation under his <i>palma Christi</i> because
Nineveh is forgiven and the sun is hot.</p>

<p>There are indeed times when humanity is tried
beyond its capacity, when the cry for restful death
is wrung from souls crushed under accumulations of
quite intolerable anguish and calamity. In the fret
of long-continued sleeplessness, in sick and desolate
and half-starved age, in attacks of disease incurable,
long-continued, and full of torture, God will surely
look with pardoning tenderness on those whose faith
is unequal to so terrible a strain. It was pardonable
surely of Job to curse the day of his birth when&mdash;smitten
with elephantiasis, a horror, a hissing, an
astonishment, bereaved of all his children, and vexed
by the obtrusive orthodoxies of his petty Pharisaic
friends; unconscious, too, that it was God's hand which
was all the while leading him through the valley of
the shadow into the land of righteousness&mdash;he cried:
"Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery,
and life to the bitter in soul?" In those who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
no hope and are without God in the world, this mood&mdash;not
when expressed in passing passion as by the
saintly man of Uz, but when brooded on and indulged&mdash;leads
to suicide, and in the one instance recorded
in each Testament, an Ahithophel and a Judas, the
despairing souls of the guilty:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Into the presence of their God<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Rushed in with insult rude."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Elijah's mood, little as it was justifiable in this
its extreme form, was but the last infirmity of a noble
mind. It has often recurred among those grandest of
the servants of God who may sink into the deepest
dejection from contrast with the spiritual altitudes to
which they have soared. It is with them as with the
lark which floods the blue air with its passion of almost
delirious rapture, yet suddenly, as though exhausted,
drops down silent into its lowly nest in the brown
furrows. There is but one man in the Old Testament
who, as a prophet, stands on the same level as Elijah,&mdash;he
who stood with Elijah on the snowy heights of
Hermon when their Lord was transfigured into celestial
brightness, and they spake together of His decease at
Jerusalem. And Moses had passed through the same
dark hour as that through which Elijah was passing
now, when he saw the tears, and heard the murmurs
of the greedy, selfish, ungrateful people, who hated
their heavenly manna, and lusted for the leeks and
fleshpots of their Egyptian bondage. Revolted by this
obtrusion upon him of human nature in its lowest
meanness, he cried to God under his intolerable burden:
"Have I conceived all this people?... I am not able to
bear all this people alone.... And if Thou deal thus
with me, kill me, I pray Thee, out of hand; and let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
not see my wretchedness." In Moses, as doubtless in
Elijah, so far from being the clamour of whining selfishness,
his anguish was part of the same mood which
made him offer his life for the redemption of the people;
which made St. Paul ready to wish himself anathema
from Jesus Christ if thereby he could save his brethren
after the flesh. Danton rose into heroism when he
exclaimed, "<i>Que mon nom soit flétri, pourvu que la
France soit libre</i>"; and Whitefield, when he cried,
"Perish George Whitefield, so God's work be done";
and the Duke of Wellington when&mdash;remonstrated with
for joining in the last charge at Waterloo, with the shot
whistling round his head&mdash;he said, "Never mind; the
victory is won, and now my life is of no consequence."
In great souls the thought of others, completely dominating
the base man's concentration in self, may create
a despondency which makes them ready to give up
their life, not because it is a burden to themselves, but
because it seems to them as if their work was over,
and it was beyond their power to do more for others.</p>

<p>Tender natures as well as strong natures are liable
to this inrush of hopelessness; and if it sometimes kills
them by its violence, this is only a part of God's training
of them into perfection.</p>

<p>The cherubim of the sanctuary had to be made of the
gold of Uphaz, the finest and purest gold. It was only
the purest gold which could be tortured by workmanship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
into forms of exquisite beauty. The mind of Jeremiah
was as unlike that of Elijah's as can possibly be
conceived. He was a man of shrinking and delicate
temperament, and his life is the most pathetic tragedy
among the biographies of Scripture. The mind of
Elijah, like those of Dante or Luther or Milton, was
all ardour and battle brunt; the mind of Jeremiah, like
that of Melancthon, was timid as that of a gentle boy.
A man like Dante or Milton, when he stands alone,
hated by princes and priests and people, retorts scorn
for scorn, and refuses to change his voice to hoarse or
mute. Yet even Dante died of a broken heart, and
in Milton's mighty autobiographical wail of Samson
Agonistes, amid all its trumpet-blast of stern defiance,
we read the sad notes:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>When the insolent priest Pashur smote Jeremiah in the
face, and put him for a night and a day in the common
stocks, the prophet&mdash;after telling Pashur that, for this
awful insult to God's messenger, his name, which meant
"joy far and wide," should be changed into Magormissa-bib,
"terror on every side"&mdash;utterly broke down,
and passionately cursed the day of his birth.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> And
yet his trials were very far from ended then. Homeless,
wifeless, childless, slandered, intrigued against, undermined&mdash;protesting
apparently in vain against the
hollow shams of a self-vaunting reformation&mdash;the object
of special hatred to all the self-satisfied religionists of
his day, the lonely persecuted servant of the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
ended only in exile and martyrdom the long trouble of
his eternally blessed but seemingly unfruitful life.</p>

<p>I dwell on this incident in the life of Elijah because
it is full of instructiveness. Scripture is not all on a
dead level. There are many pages of it which belong
indeed to the connected history, and therefore carry on
the general lessons of the history, but which are, in
themselves, almost empty of any spiritual profit. Only
a fantastic and artificial method of sermonising can
extract from them, taken alone, any Divine lessons. In
these Books of Kings many of the records are simply
historical, and in themselves, apart from their place in
the whole, have no more religious significance than any
other historic facts; but because these annals are the
annals of a chosen people, and because these books are
written for our learning, we find in them again and
again, and particularly in their more connected and
elevated narratives, facts and incidents which place
Scripture incomparably above all secular literature,
and are rich in eternal truth for all time, and for a
life beyond life.</p>

<p>It is with such an experience that we are dealing
here, and therefore it is worth while, if we can, to see
something of its meaning. We may, therefore, be
permitted to linger for a brief space over the causes
of Elijah's despair, and the method in which God dealt
with it.</p>

</div></div>


<p>What are the causes which may drive even a
saint of God into a mood of momentary despair
as he is forced to face the semblance of final failure?</p>

<p>1. Even the lowest element of such despair has its
instructiveness. It was due in part, doubtless, to mere
physical exhaustion. Elijah had just gone through the
most tremendous conflict of his life. During all that
long and most exhausting day at Carmel he had had little
or no food, and at the close of it he had run across all
the plain with the king's chariot. In the dead of that
night, with his life in his hand, he had fled towards
Beersheba, and now he had wandered for a whole day
in the glare of the famishing wilderness. It does not
do to despise the body. If we <i>are</i> spirits, yet we <i>have</i>
bodies; and the body wreaks a stern and humiliating
vengeance on those who neglect or despise it. The
body reacts upon the mind. "If you rumple the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
jerkin, you rumple the jerkin's lining." If we weaken
the body too much, we do not make it the slave of
the spirit, but rather make the spirit its slave. Even
moderate fasting, as a simple physiological fact&mdash;if it
be <i>fasting</i> at all, as distinguished from healthful moderation
and wise temperance&mdash;tends to increase, and not
by any means to decrease, the temptations which come
to us from the appetites of the body. Extreme self-maceration&mdash;as
all ascetics have found from the days
of St. Jerome to those of Cardinal Newman&mdash;only adds
new fury to the lusts of the flesh. Many a hermit
and stylite and fasting monk, many half-dazed, hysterical,
high-wrought men have found, sometimes without
knowing the reason of it, that by wilful and artificial
devices of self-chosen saintliness, they have made the
path of purity and holiness not easier, but more hard.
The body is a temple, not a tomb. It is not permitted
us to think ourselves wiser than God who made it,
nor to fancy that we can mend His purposes by
torturing and crushing it. By violating the laws of
physical righteousness we only make moral and spiritual
righteousness more difficult to attain.</p>

<p>2. Elijah's dejection was also due to forced inactivity.
"What <i>doest</i> thou here, Elijah?" said the voice of God
to him in the heart of man. Alas! he was doing
nothing: there was nothing left for him to do! It
was different when he hid by the brook Cherith, or
in Zarephath, or in the glades of Carmel. Then a
glorious endeavour lay before him, and there was
hope. But</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Life without hope draws nectar in a sieve,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And hope without an object cannot live."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The mighty vindication of Jehovah in which all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
struggle of his life culminated, had been crowned with
triumph, and had failed. It had blazed up like fire,
and had sunk back into ashes. To such a spirit as
his nothing is so fatal as to have nothing to do and
nothing to hope for. "What did the Maréchal
die of?" asked a distinguished Frenchman of one of
his comrades. "He died of having nothing to do."
"Ah!" was the reply; "that is enough to kill the
best General of us all."</p>

<p>3. Again, Elijah was suffering from mental reaction.
The bow had been bent too long, and was somewhat
strained; the tense string needed to have been relaxed
before. It is a common experience that some great
duty or mastering emotion uplifts us for a time above
ourselves, makes us even forget the body and its needs.
We remember Jeremy Taylor's description of what
he had noticed in the Civil Wars,&mdash;that a wounded
soldier, amid the heat and fury of the fight, was wholly
unconscious of his wounds, and only began to feel the
smart of them when the battle had ended and its fierce
passion was entirely spent.</p>

<p>Men, even strong men, after hours of terrible
excitement, have been known to break down and
weep like children. Macaulay, in describing the emotions
which succeeded the announcement that the
Reform Bill had passed, says that not a few, after
the first outburst of wild enthusiasm, were bathed in
tears.</p>

<p>And any one who has seen some great orator after
a supreme effort of eloquence, when his strength seems
drained away, and the passion is exhausted, and the
flame has sunk down into its embers, is aware how
painful a reaction often follows, and how differently the
man looks and feels if you see him when he has passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
into his retirement, pale and weak, and often very sad.
After a time the mind can do no more.</p>

<p>4. Further, Elijah felt his loneliness. At that moment
indeed he could not bear the presence of any one, but
none the less his sense that none sympathised with
him, that all hated him, that no voice was raised to
cheer him, that no finger was uplifted to help him,
weighed like lead upon his spirit. "I only am left."
There was awful desolation in that thought. He was
alone among an apostatising people. It is the same
kind of cry which we hear so often in the life of God's
saints. It is the Psalmist crying: "I am become like a
pelican in the wilderness, and like an owl that is in the
desert. Mine enemies reproach me all the day long,
and they that are mad upon me are sworn together
against me";<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> or, "My lovers and my neighbours did
stand looking upon my trouble, and my kinsmen stood
afar off. They also that sought after my life laid snares
for me."<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> It is Job so smitten and afflicted that he is
half tempted for the moment to curse God and die. It
is Isaiah saying of the hopeless wickedness of his people,
"The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint."
It is Jeremiah complaining, "The prophets prophesy
falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and
my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the
end thereof?"<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> It is St. Paul wailing so sadly, "All
they of Asia have turned from me. Only Luke is with
me." It is the pathos of desolation which breathes
through the sad sentence of the Gospels, "Then all
the disciples forsook Him, and fled." The anticipation
of desertion had wrung from the Lord Jesus the sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
prophesy, "Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come,
when ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and
shall leave Me alone: and yet I am not alone, because
the Father is with Me."<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> And this heart-anguish of
loneliness is, to this day, a common experience of the
best men. Any man whose duty has ever called him
to strike out against the stream of popular opinion, to
rebuke the pleasant vices of the world, to plead for
causes too righteous to be popular, to deny the existence
of vested interests in the causes of human ruin,
to tell a corrupt society that it is corrupt, and a lying
Church that it lies;&mdash;any man who has had to defy
mere plausible conventions of veiled wrong-doing, to
give bold utterance to forgotten truths, to awake sodden
and slumbering consciences, to annul agreements with
death and covenants with hell; every man who rises
above the trimmers and the facing-both-ways, and those
who try to serve two masters&mdash;they who swept away
the rotting superstitions of a tyrannous ecclesiasticism,
they who purified prisons, they who struck the fetters
off the slave&mdash;every saint, reformer, philanthropist, and
faithful preacher in the past, and those now living
saints, who, walking in the shining steps of these,
endeavour to rescue the miserable out of the gutter,
and to preach the gospel to the poor, know the anguish
of isolation, when, because they have been benefactors,
they are cursed as though they were felons, and when,
for the efforts of their noble self-sacrifice, the contempt
of the world, and its pedantry, and its malice can find
for them no words too contemptuous or too bitterly
false.</p>

<p>5. But there was even a deeper sorrow than these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
which made Elijah long for death. It was the sense of
utter and seemingly irretrievable failure. It happens
often to the worldling as well as to the saint. Many a
man, weary of life's inexorable emptiness, has exclaimed
in different ways:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Know that whatever thou hast been,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'Tis something better not to be."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That sentiment is not in the least peculiar to Byron.
We find it again and again in the Greek tragedians.
We find it alike in the legendary revelation of the god
Pan, and in the Book of Ecclesiastes, and in Schopenhauer
and Von Hartmann. No true Christian, no
believer in the mercy and justice of God, can share
that sentiment, but will to the last thank God for His
creation and preservation and all the blessings of this
life, as well as for the inestimable gift of His redemption,
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.
Nevertheless, it is part of God's discipline that He often
requires His saints as well as His sinners to face what
looks like hopeless discomfiture, and to perish, as it
were,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In the lost battle<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Borne down by the flying,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where mingles war's rattle<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With groans of the dying."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such was the fate of all the Prophets. They were
tortured; they had trials of cruel mockings and
scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment;
they were stoned, were sawn asunder, were tempted,
were slain with the sword; they wandered about in
sheepskins and goatskins, they hid in caves and dens
of the earth, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, though
of them the world was not worthy. Such, too, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
fate of all the Apostles&mdash;set forth last of all as men
doomed to death; made a spectacle to the world, to
angels, and to men. They were hungry, thirsty, naked,
buffeted; they had no certain dwelling-place; they were
treated as fools and weak, were dishonoured, defamed,
treated as the filth of the world and the offscouring of
all things. Such was conspicuously the case of St. Paul
in that death, so lonely and forsaken, that the French
sceptic thinks he must have awakened with infinite
regret from the disillusionment of a futile life. Nay,
it was the earthly lot of Him who was the prototype,
and consolation, known or unknown, of all these:&mdash;it
was the lot of Him who, from that which seemed the
infinite collapse and immeasurable abandonment of
His cross of shame, cried out: "My God, My God,
why hast Thou forsaken Me?" He warned His
true followers that they, too, would have to face the
same finality of earthly catastrophes, to die without
the knowledge, without even the probable hope, that
they have accomplished anything, in utter forsakenment,
in a monotony of execration, often in dejection
and apparent hiding of God's countenance. The olden
saints who prepared the way for Christ, and those
who since His coming have followed His footsteps,
have had to learn that true life involves a bearing of
the cross.</p>

<p>Take but one or two out of countless instances.
Look at that humble brown figure, kneeling drowned
with tears to think of the disorders which had already
begun to creep into the holy order which he had
designed. It is sweet St. Francis of Assisi, to whom
God said in visions: "Poor little man: thinkest thou
that I, who rule the universe, cannot direct in My own
way thy little order?" Look at that monk in his friars'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
dress, racked, tortured, gibbeted in fetters over the
flaming pyre in the great square at Florence, stripped
by guilty priests of his priestly robe, degraded from a
guilty Church by its guilty representatives, pelted by
wanton boys, dying amid a roar of execration from the
brutal and fickle multitude whose hearts he once had
moved. It is Savonarola, the prophet of Florence.
Look at that poor preacher dragged from his dungeon
to the stake at Basle, wearing the yellow cap and sanbenito
painted with flames and devils. It is John Huss,
the preacher of Bohemia. Look at the lion-hearted
reformer feeling how much he had striven, not knowing
as yet how much he had achieved, appealing to God to
govern His world, saying that he was but a powerless
man, and would be "the veriest ass alive" if he thought
that he could meddle with the intricacies of Divine
Providence. It is Luther. Look at the youth, starving
in an ink-stained garret, hunted through the streets by
an infuriated mob, thrust into the city prison as the
only way to save his life from those who hated his
exposure of their iniquities. It is William Lloyd
Garrison. Look at that missionary, deserted, starving,
fever-stricken, in the midst of savages, dying on his
knees, in daily sufferings, amid frustrated hopes. It
is David Livingstone, the pioneer of Africa. They,
and thousands like them, have borne squalors and
shames and tragedies, while they looked not at the
things that are seen, but at the things that are not
seen; for the things that are seen are temporal, but the
things which are not seen are eternal. Might not they
all have said with the disappointed Apostles, "Master,
we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing"?
Might not their lives and deaths&mdash;the lives which fools
thought madness, and their end to be without honour&mdash;be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI.</a></h2>

<h3><i>HOW GOD DEALS WITH DESPONDENCY.</i></h3>

<p class="center">1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> xix. 5-8.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Why art thou so vexed, O my soul? and why art thou so disquieted
within me? O put thy trust in God; for I will yet praise
Him who is the health of my countenance, and my God."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm</span>
xlii. 11.</p></blockquote>


<p>"It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life;
for I am not better than my fathers."</p>

<p>The despondency was deeper than personal. It was
despair of the world; despair of the fate of the true
worship; despair about the future of faith and righteousness;
despair of everything. Elijah, in his condition
of pitiable weariness, felt himself reduced to entire
uncertainty about all God's dealings with him and with
mankind. "I am not better than my fathers": <i>they</i>
failed one by one, and died, and entered the darkness;
and I have failed likewise. To what end did Moses
lead this people through the wilderness? Why did
the Judges fight and deliver them? Of what use was
the wise guidance of Samuel? What has come of
David's harp, and Solomon's temple and magnificence,
and Jeroboam's heaven-directed rebellion? It ends,
and my work ends, in the despotism of Jezebel, and
a nation of apostates!</p>

<p>God pitied His poor suffering servant, and gently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
led him back to hope and happiness, and restored him
to his true self, and to the natural elasticity of his free
spirit.</p>

<p>1. First, he gave His beloved sleep. Elijah lay down
and slept. Perhaps this was what he needed most of
all. When we lose that dear oblivion of "nature's soft
nurse, and sweet restorer, balmy sleep," then nerve
and brain give way. So God sent him</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">"The innocent sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep that knits up the ravelled sleeve of care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chief nourisher in life's feast."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And doubtless, while he slept, "his sleeping mind,"
as the Greek tragedian says, "was bright with eyes,"
and He, who had thus "steeped his senses in forgetfulness,"
spoke peace to his troubled heart, or breathed
into it the rest over which hope might brood with her
halcyon wings.</p>

<p>2. Next, God provided him with food. When he
awoke he saw that at his head, under the rhotem-plant,
God had spread him a table in the wilderness. It was
a provision, simple indeed, but for his moderate wants
more than sufficient&mdash;a cake baked on the coals<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> and
a cruse of water. A <i>Maleakh</i>&mdash;a "messenger"&mdash;"some
one," as the Septuagint and as Josephus both render
it,<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> some one who was, to him at any rate, an angel
of God&mdash;touched him, and said, "Arise and eat." He
ate and drank, and thus refreshed lay down again to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
make up, perhaps, for long arrears of unrest. And
again God's messenger, human or angelic, touched him,
and bade him rise and eat once more, or his strength
would fail in the journey which lay before him. For
he meant to plunge yet farther into the wilderness.
In the language of the narrator, "He arose, and did
eat and drink, and went in the strength of that food
forty days and forty nights."</p>

<p>3. Next God sent him on a hallowed pilgrimage
to bathe his weary spirit in the memories of a brighter
past.</p>

<p>It does not require forty days and forty nights, nor
anything like so long a period, to get from one day's
journey in the wilderness to Horeb, the Mount of
God, which was Elijah's destination. The distance
does not exceed one hundred and eighty miles even from
Beersheba. But, as in the case of Moses and of our
Lord, "forty days"&mdash;a number connected by many
associations with the idea of penance and temptation&mdash;symbolises
the period of Elijah's retirement
and wanderings. No doubt, too, the number has an
allusive significance, pointing back to the forty years'
wanderings of Israel in the wilderness. The Septuagint
omits the words "of God," but there can be little
doubt that Sinai was selected for the goal of Elijah's
pilgrimage with reference to the awful scenes connected
with the promulgation of the law. It is well known that
the Mount of the Commandments is as a rule called
Sinai in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, though the
name Horeb occurs in Exod. iii. 1, xxxiii. 6. To account
for the double usage there have been, since the Middle
Ages, two theories: (1) that Horeb is the name of
the range, and Sinai of the mountain; (2) that Horeb
properly means the northern part of the range, and Sinai<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
the southern, especially Jebel Mousa. Horeb is the
prevalent name for the mountain in Deuteronomy; Sinai
is the ordinary name, and occurs thirty-one times in the
Old Testament.</p>

<p>After his wanderings Elijah reached Mount Sinai,
and came to "the cave," and took shelter there. The
use of the article shows that a particular cave is meant,
and there can be little reason to discredit the almost
immemorial tradition that it is the hollow still pointed
out to hundreds of pilgrims as the scene of the theophany
which was here granted to Elijah. Perhaps in
the same cave the vision had been granted to Moses,
in the scene to which this narrative looks back. It is
not so much a cave as, what it is called in Exodus, a
"cleft of the rock."<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> From the foot of the mountain,
the level space on which now stands the monastery of
Saint Katherine, a steep and narrow pathway through
the rocks leads up to Jebel Mousa, the southernmost peak
of Sinai, which is seven thousand feet high. Half-way
up this mountain is a little secluded plain in the inmost
heart of the granite precipice, in which is an enclosed
garden, and a solitary cypress, and a spring and pool
of water, and a little chapel. Inside the chapel is
shown a hole, barely large enough to contain the body
of a man. "It is," says Dr. Allon, "a temple not
made with hands, into which, through a stupendous
granite screen, which shuts out even the Bedouin
world, God's priests may enter to commune with
Him."<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If, indeed, Elijah had heard by tradition the vision of
Moses of which this was the scene, he must have been
filled with awful thoughts as he rested in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
narrow fissure, and recalled what had been handed
down respecting the manifestation of Jehovah to his
mighty predecessor.</p>

<p>4. And as God had pointed out to him the way to
restore his bodily strength by sleep and food, so now
He opened before the Prophet the remedy of renewed
activity. The question of the Lord came to him&mdash;it was
re-echoed by the voice of his own conscience&mdash;"What
doest thou here, Elijah?"</p>

<p>"What doest thou?" He was doing nothing! He
had, indeed, fled for his life; but was all the rest of his
life to be so different from its beginning? Was there,
indeed, no more work to be done in Israel or in Judah,
and was he tamely to allow Jezebel to be the final
mistress of the situation? Was one alien and idolatrous
woman to overawe God's people Israel, and to snatch
from God's prophet all the fruits of his righteous
labours? "What doest <i>thou</i> here, Elijah?" Is not
the very significance of thy name "Jehovah, He is my
God"? Is He to be the God but of one fugitive?
"What doest thou <i>here</i>?" This is the wilderness.
There are no idolaters or murderers, or breakers of
God's commandments here; but are there not multitudes
in the crowded cities where Baal's temple towers over
Samaria, and his sun-pillars cast their offensive shadows?
Are there not multitudes in Jezreel, where the queen's
Asherah-shrine amid its guilt-shrouding trees flings
its dark protection over unhallowed orgies committed
in the name of religion? Should there not have been
inspiration as well as reproof in the mere question?
Should it not mean to him, "Why art thou cast down,
O my soul? and why art thou so disquieted within me?
Put thy trust in God, for I will yet praise Him, who is
the health of my countenance, and my God"?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span></p>

<p>5. The question stirred the heart of Elijah, but did
not yet dispel his sense of hopelessness and frustration,
nor did it restore his confidence that God would govern
the world aright. As yet it only called forth the heavy
murmur of his grief. "I have been very jealous for
Jehovah the God of Hosts": I, alone among my people;
"for the children of Israel"&mdash;not the wicked queen only,
with her abominations and witchcrafts, but the renegade
people with her&mdash;"have forsaken Thy covenant," which
forbids them to have any God but Thee, and have
"thrown down Thine altars,<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> and slain Thy prophets
with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they
seek my life, to take it away." It was as it were an
appeal to Jehovah before whom he stood, if not almost
a reproach to Him. It was as though he said, "I have
done my utmost; I have failed: wilt not Thou put forth
Thy power and reign? I am but one poor hunted
prophet alone against the world. There is no prophet
more: not one is there among them that understandeth
any more. I can do no more. Of what use is my life?
Carest Thou not that Thy people have revolted from
Thee? Behold they perish; they perish, they all
perish! Of what use is my life? My work has failed:
let me die!"</p>

<p>6. God dealt with this mood as He has done in all
ages, as He had done before to Jacob, as He did afterwards
to David and to Hezekiah, and to Isaiah and
Jeremiah; and as the Son of God did to the antitype
of Elijah&mdash;the great forerunner&mdash;when his faith failed
him. He let the conviction steal into his mind that
the ways of God are wider than men, and His thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
greater than men's. He unteaches His prophet the
delusion that everything depends on <i>him</i>. He shows
him that though He works for men by men, and though</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"God cannot make best man's best<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Without best men to help Him,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>still no living man is necessary, nor can any man, however
great, either hasten or understand the purposes of
God.</p>

<p>Elijah had need to be taught that man is nothing&mdash;that
God is all in all. Instead of answering his complaint,
the voice said to him: "Go forth to-morrow, and stand
upon the mount before the Lord. Behold, the Lord is
passing by."<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Who heardest the rebuke of the Lord in Sinai, and in Horeb the
judgment of vengeance."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ecclus.</span> xlviii. 7.</p></blockquote>


<p>Throughout the Scriptures infinite care is
taken to preclude every notion that the Most
High God can be represented in visible form. He
manifested Himself at Sinai to the children of Israel,
but though the mount burned with fire, and there were
clouds and thick darkness, and the voice of a trumpet
speaking long and loud, the people were reminded with
the utmost solemnity that "they saw no manner of
similitude."<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> Indeed, in later times, when there was
a keener jealousy of every anthropomorphic expression,
the giving of the law is rather represented as a part of
the ministry of angels. The word <i>Makom</i>, or "Place,"
is substituted for Jehovah, so that Moses and the
elders and the Israelites do not see God but only His
<i>Makom</i>, the space which He fills;<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> the delivery of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
law is ascribed to angelic ministers. At times the
angels are almost identified with the careering flames
and rushing winds which a modern theologian describes
to us as being "the skirts of their garments, the waving
of their robes"; for is it not written, "He that maketh
the winds His angels and the flaming fires His
ministers"?<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> And in the daring description of
Jehovah's visible manifestation of Himself to Moses,
when He hid him in that fissure of the rock with the
hollow of His hand, Moses only observes as it were
the fringe and evanishment of His glory, "dark with
excessive light."</p>

<p>It was natural that Jehovah should reveal Himself
to Elijah under the aspect of those awful elemental
forces with which his solitary life had made him familiar.
No spot in the world is more suitable for those powers
in all their fire and magnificence than the knot of
mountains which crowd the Sinaitic peninsula with
their entangled cliffs. Travellers have borne witness
to the overwhelming violence and majesty of the storms
which rush and reverberate through the granite gorges
of those everlasting hills. It was in such surroundings
that Jehovah spoke to the heart of his servant.</p>

<p>First "a great and strong wind rent the mountains,
and brake in pieces the rocks, before the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
winds of God, which blow where they list, and we know
not whence they come nor whither they go, have in
them so awful and irresistible a strength, that man
and the works of man, are reduced to impotence before
them. And when they rush and roar through the
gullies of innumerable hills in tropic lands where the
intense heat has rarefied the air, the sound of them
is beyond all comparison weird and terrific. We cannot
wonder that this roar of the hurricane was regarded as
the trump of the archangel and the voice of God at
Sinai; or that the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind;<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>
and appeared to Ezekiel in a great cloud and
a whirlwind out of the north;<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> or that Jeremiah compared
His anger to a whirling and sweeping storm;<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>
or that the Psalmist describes Him as bowing the
heavens and coming down and casting darkness under
His feet, and flying upon a cherub, and walking upon
the wings of the wind;<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> or that Nahum says, "The
Lord hath His way in the whirlwind and the storm,
and the clouds are the dust of His feet, ... and the
mountains quake at Him."<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a></p>

<p>And Elijah felt the terror of the scene, as the storm
dislodged huge masses of the mountain granite, and
sent them rolling and crashing down the hills. But
it did not speak to his inmost heart: for</p>

<p>"The Lord was not in the wind."</p>

<p>And after the wind an earthquake shook the solid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
bases of the Sinaitic range. The mountain saw God
and trembled. The Lord, in the language of the
Psalmist, shook the wilderness of Kadesh, the mountains
skipped like rams and the little hills like young sheep.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>
And man never feels so abjectly helpless, he is never
reduced to such absolute insignificance, as when the
solid earth beneath him, the very emblem of stability,
trembles as with a palsy, and cleaves beneath his
feet; and shakes his towers to the earth, and swallows
up his cities. Once more the soul of Elijah shuddered
at the terrific impression of this sign of Jehovah's power.
But it had no message for his inmost heart: for</p>

<p>"The Lord was not in the earthquake."</p>

<p>And after the earthquake a fire. Jehovah overwhelmed
the Prophet's senses with the dread magnificence
of one of those lurid thunderstorms of which the
terrors are never so tremendous as in such mountain
scenes, where travellers tell us that the burning air
seems transfused into sheets of flame. In that awful
muttering and roar of the lurid clouds, that millionfold
reverberation of what the Psalmist calls "the voice
of the Lord," when the lightnings "light the world,
and run along the ground," and, in the language of
Habakkuk, "God sends abroad His arrows, and the
light of His glittering spear, and burning coals go forth
under His feet, the lips of man quiver at the voice,
and his heart sinks, and he trembles where he stands."
And this, too, Elijah must have felt as "the hiding-place
of God's power:"<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> and yet it did not speak to his
inmost heart; for</p>

<p>"The Lord was not in the fire."</p>

<p>"And after the fire a still small voice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span></p>

<p>However the rendering may be altered into "a gentle
murmuring sound," or, as in the Revised Version, "a
sound of gentle stillness," no expression is more full
of the awe and mystery of the original than the phrase
"a still small voice."<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> It was the shock of awful
stillness which succeeded the sudden cessation of the
earthquake and hurricane and thunderstorm, and
instantly, in it appalling hush and gentleness, Elijah
felt that God was there; and he no sooner heard that
voiceful silence speaking within him than he was filled
with fear and self-abasement. He wrapped his face
in his mantle, even as Moses "was afraid to look upon
God." He came from the hollow of the rock which
had sheltered him amidst that turbulence of material
forces, and stood in the entering in of the cave.</p>

<p>At once the silence became articulate to his conscience,
and repeated to him the reproachful question,
"What doest thou here, Elijah?"</p>

<p>Amazed and overwhelmed as he is, he has not yet
grasped the meaning of the vision. Something of it
perhaps he saw and felt. It breathed something of
peace into the despair and tumult of his heart, but he
still can only answer as before:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have been very jealous for the Lord God of
hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken Thy
covenant, thrown down Thine altars, and slain Thy
prophets with the sword; and I, I only, am left; and
they seek my life, to take it away."</p>

<p>Whatever that theophany had taught him, it had
not yet fully removed his perplexity. But now God,
in tender forbearance, unfolds at any rate the practical
issue of the vision. Elijah is to be inactive no longer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
He is to find in faithfulness and work the removal of
all doubts, and is to learn that man may not abandon
his duties, even when they are irksome, even when
they seem hopeless, even when they have become
intolerable and full of peril. He has to learn that it
is only when men have finished their day's work that
God sends them sleep, and that his own day's work
was as yet unfinished. He is no longer to linger in
the wilderness apart from the ways of guilty and suffering
men. He is one with them: he may not separate
his destiny from theirs; he has to feel that God has
no favourites and is no respecter of persons, but that
all men are His children, and that each child of His
must work for all. "Go," the Lord said unto him,
"return on thy way by the wilderness to Damascus."
Did the return involve unknown dangers? Still he
must commit his way unto the Lord, and simply be doing
good, regardless of all consequences. The saints of
the Old Dispensation no less than of the New had to go
forth bearing their cross, and on their way to Golgotha.</p>

<p>Three missions still awaited him.</p>

<p>First, he is to supersede the old dynasty of Benhadad,
King of Syria, founded by Solomon's enemy, and to
anoint Hazael to be king over Syria.</p>

<p>Next, he is to abolish the dynasty of Omri, and to
anoint Jehu, the son of Nimshi, to be king over Israel.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a></p>

<p>Thirdly&mdash;and there was deep significance in this
behest, and one which must have humiliated to the dust
the risings of pride and the half-reproach, so to speak,
for inadequate support which had underlain his appeal
to Jehovah&mdash;he is to anoint Elisha, the son of Shaphat,
of Abel-meholah, to be prophet in his room.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span></p>
<p>Elijah had thought himself necessary&mdash;an indispensable
agent for the task of delivering Israel from
the guilty and demoralising apostasy of Baal-worship.
God teaches him that there is no such thing as a necessary
man; that man at his best estate is altogether
vanity; that God is all in all; that "God buries His
workmen, but continues His work."</p>

<p>And something of the meaning of these tasks is
explained to him. The people of Israel are not yet
converted. They still needed the hand of chastisement.
The three years' drought had been ineffectual to wean
them from their backslidings, and turn their hearts
again to the Lord. On the royal house and on the
worshippers of Baal should fall the remorseless sword
of Jehu. On the whole nation the ruthless invasions
of Hazael should press with terrible penalty. And him
that escaped from their avenging missions should Elisha
slay. The last clause is enigmatical. Elisha can hardly
be said directly to have slain any. He lived, on the
whole, in friendship with the kings both of Israel and
of Aram, and in peace and honour in the cities. But
the general idea seems to be that he would carry on
the mission of Elijah alike for the guidance and the
heaven-directed punishments of kings and nations, and
that the famines, raids, and humiliations which rendered
his nation miserable under the sons of Ahab should be
elements of his sacred mission.<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a></p>

<p>One more revelation remained to lift the Prophet
above his lower self. His cry had been, again and
again: "I, I only, am left; and they seek my life, to
take it away." He must not indulge the mistaken
fancy that the worship of the true God would die with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
him, or that God needed his advice, or that God was
slack concerning His promise as some men count
slackness. He was not the only faithful person left,
nor would truth perish when he was called away. Nor
is he to judge only by outward appearances, nor to
suppose that the arm of God can be measured by the
finger of man. A new prophet is soon to take his
place, but God has not been so neglectful as he supposes,&mdash;"Yet,"
in spite of all thy murmurings of failure
and a frustrated purpose&mdash;"yet will I leave Me"&mdash;not
<i>thee, thee only</i>&mdash;"but <i>seven thousand</i> in Israel, all the
knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every
mouth which has not kissed him."<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a></p>

<p>It has been regarded as a difficulty that Elijah
fulfilled but one of the three behests. But Scripture
does not narrate events with the finical and pragmatic
accuracy of modern annals. Elisha, directly or indirectly,
caused both Jehu to be anointed and Hazael to ascend
the throne of Syria, and we are left to infer that in
these deeds he carried out the instructions of his Master.</p>

<p>It is a more serious question, What was the exact
meaning of the theophany granted to Elijah on the
Mount of God?</p>

<p>Here, too, we are left to large and liberal applications.
The greatest utterances of men, the loftiest works of
human genius, often admit of manifold interpretations,
and lend themselves to "springing and germinal
developments." Far more is this the case in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
revelations of God to the spirit of man. We can see
the main truths which were involved in that mighty
scene, even if the narrator of it leaves unexplained its
central significance.</p>

<p>It is usually interpreted as a reproof to the spirit
which led Elijah to regard the tempestuous manifestations
of wrath and vengeance as the normal methods
of the interposition of God. He was fresh from the
stern challenge of Carmel; his hands were yet red
with the blood of those four hundred and fifty priests.
It was perhaps needful for him to learn that God's
gentler agencies are more effectual and more expressive
of His inmost nature, and that God is Love even though
He can by no means clear the guilty. Something of
this lesson has been at all times learnt from the
narrative.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a></p>

<p>Quite naturally men have always seen in the storm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
the earthquake, and the fire, the presence of God as
manifested in His wrath. "Then the earth shook and
trembled," says the Psalmist; "the foundations also
of the hills moved and were shaken, because He was
wroth. There went up a smoke in His nostrils, and
fire out of His mouth devoured: coals burnt forth from
it. He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and
darkness was under His feet. And He rode upon a
cherub, and swooped down: yea, He did fly upon the
wings of the wind."<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> "I will shake the heavens, and

"of the Lord of Hosts with thunder, and with earthquake,
and great noise, with storm and tempest, and
the flame of devouring fire."<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> On the other hand, in
His mercy God "maketh the storm a calm." When
He reveals Himself in a vision of the night to Eliphaz
the Temanite "a wind passed before my face, so that
the hair of my head stood up, and there was silence,
and I heard a voice saying, Shall mortal man be great
before God? shall a man be pure before his Maker?"
These passages in no small measure explain the symbolism
of Elijah's vision, and point to its essential
significance. Who can measure (asks Mr. Ruskin) the
total effect produced upon the minds of men by the
phenomenon of a single thunderstorm?&mdash;"the questioning
of the forest leaves together in their terrified stillness
which way the wind shall come&mdash;the murmuring together
of the Angels of Destruction as they draw in the
distance their swords of flame&mdash;the rattling of the
dome of heaven under the chariot wheels of death?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
Yet it is not the thunderstorms nor the hurricanes
that have been most powerful in altering the face
or moulding the structure of the world, but rather the
long continuance of Nature's most gentle influences.</p>

<p>Viewing the vision thus, we may say that it pointed
forward to that transcendently greater than Elijah who
did not strive, nor cry, nor was His voice heard in the
streets. "There is already a gospel of Elijah. He,
the farthest removed of all the Prophets from the
evangelical spirit and character, had yet enshrined in
the heart of his story the most forcible of all protests
against the hardness of Judaism, the noblest anticipation
of the breadth and depth of Christianity." This
view of the passage is taken, with slight modifications,
by many, from Irenæus down to Grotius and Calvin,
and modern commentators.</p>

<p>Similarly it is a universal law of history that, while
some mighty and tumultuous energy may be needed to
initiate the first movement or upheaval, the greatest
work is done by gentler agencies. As in the old fable,
the quiet shining of the sun effects more than the
bluster of the storm. Love is stronger than force, and
persuasion than compulsion. Mr. J. S. Mill treats it
not only as a platitude but as a falsity to assert that
truth cannot be suppressed by violence. He says that
(for instance) the truths brought into prominence by
the Reformation had been again and again suppressed
by the brutal tyrannies of the Papacy. But in all these
instances has not the truth ultimately prevailed? Is it
not a fact of experience that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Truth, pressed to earth shall rise again,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">The eternal years of God are hers;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But error, wounded, writhes in pain<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And dies among her worshippers"?<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span></p>
<p>The truth prevails and the error dies under the slow
light of knowledge and by the long results of time.</p>

<p>Nor is it any answer to this view of the revelation
to Elijah on the Mount of God that there is not the
slightest proof of his having learnt any such lesson, or
of such a lesson having been deduced from it by the
narrator himself. Neither Elijah, it has been said, nor
the writer of the Book of Kings, felt the smallest regret
for the avenging deed of Carmel. Their consciences
approved of it. They looked on it with pride, not with
compunction. This is shown by the subsequently
recorded story of Elijah's calling down fire from
heaven on the unfortunate captains and soldiers of
Ahaziah, in whatever light we regard that story which
was evidently current in the Schools of the Prophets.
If the massacre of the priests cannot be regarded as
morally excusable, the destruction of these royal emissaries
by consuming fire was certainly much less so.
The vision may have had a deeper significance than
Elijah or the Schools of the Prophets understood, just
as the words of Jesus often had a deeper significance
than was dreamt of even by the Apostles when they
heard them. The foolishness of God is wiser than
men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
Neither Elijah nor the sacred historian may have
grasped all that was meant by the wind, and earthquake,
and fire, and still small voice.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As little children sleep and dream of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So thoughts beyond their thoughts to those high bards were given."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is scarcely more than another aspect of the many-sided
truth that love is more potent and more Divine
than violence, if we also see in this incident a foreshadowing
of the truth, so necessary for the impatient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
souls of men that God neither hasteth nor resteth;
that He is patient because Eternal; that a thousand
years in His sight are but as yesterday, seeing that it is
past as a dream in the night. Something of this we
learn from the study of nature. It used to be thought
that the upheaval of the continents and the rearing of
the great mountains was due to cataclysms and conflagrations
and vast explosions of volcanic force. It has
long been known that they are due, on the contrary, to
the inconceivably slow modifications produced by the
most insignificant causes. It is the age-long accumulation
of mica-flakes which has built up the mighty
bastions of the Alps. It is the toil of the ephemeral
coral insect which has reared whole leagues of the
American Continent and filled the Pacific Ocean with
those unnumbered isles</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Which, like to rich and various gems, inlay<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The unadorned bosom of the deep."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is the slow silting up of the rivers which has
created vast deltas for the home of man. It has
required the calcareous deposit of millions of animalculæ
to produce even one inch of the height of the white
cliffs along the shores. Even so the thoughts of man
have been made more merciful in the slow course of
ages, and quiet, incommensurable influences have caused
all those advances in civilisation and humanity which
elevate our race. The "bright invisible air" has produced
effects incomparably more stupendous than the
wild tornadoes. "That air, so gentle, so imperceptible,
is more powerful, not only than all the creatures that
breathe and live by it, not only than all the oaks of the
forest which it rears in an age and shatters in a moment,
not only than the monsters of the sea, but than the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
itself, which it tosses up with foam and breaks upon
every rock in its vast circumference; for it carries in its
bosom all perfect calm, and compresses the incontrollable
ocean and the peopled earth, like an atom of a
feather."<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></p>

<p>"Thus regarded," says Professor Van Oort, "the
picture of Elijah at Mount Horeb is full of consolation
to all lovers of the truth. Sometimes they cry, All is
lost! and are ready to despair. But God answers,
Never lose heart. Storms in which God is not, in
which the power of darkness seems to sweep unbridled
and unconquered o'er the earth, come before the
whispering of the cooling breeze, but the kingdom of
peace and blessedness is ever drawing nigh. Let all
who love God truly, work for its 'approach.'"</p>

<p>Let us then cling to the lesson that mercy is better
than sacrifice, and is transcendently to be preferred to
holocausts of human sacrifice, even when the victims
are polluted and cruel idolaters. Scripture never hides
from us the imperfections of its heroes, and St. James
tells us that Elijah was but a man of like passions with
ourselves. The progress of the generations, the slow
shining of the light of God, has not been in vain, and
we can see truths and read the meaning of theophanies
by the experience of three subsequent millenniums, of
which two have followed the incarnation of the Son of
God.</p>

<p>Whether Elijah saw or saw not all that God
had meant by the revelation at Horeb, much
at any rate was abundantly clear to him, and the path
of new duties lay straight before him.</p>

<p>The first of those duties&mdash;the only one immediately
possible&mdash;was to anoint Elisha as prophet in his room,
and so prepare for the continuation of the task which
he had been chosen to inaugurate. He had been
bidden to return across the wilderness in the direction
of Damascus. Whether he traversed the eastern side
of Jordan among his own familiar hills of Gilead, and
then crossed over at Bethshean, where there was a
ford, or whether, braving an danger from Jezebel and
her emissaries, he passed through the territories of the
western tribes, it is certain that we find him next at
Abel-meholah, "the meadow of the dance," which was
not far from Bethshean.<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> This, as he knew, was the
home of Elisha, his future successor.</p>

<p>The position of Elisha was wholly unlike his own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
He himself was a homeless Bedawy, bound to earth by
no ties of family, coming like the wind and vanishing
like the lightning. Elisha, on the other hand, whose
history was to be so different and so far less stormy&mdash;Elisha,
whose work and whose residence was mainly
to be in cities&mdash;was a child of civilisation. But the
civilisation was still that of a society in which anarchic
forces were by no means tamed. Dean Stanley, in his
sketch of Elisha, seems to dwell too much on his
gentleness of spirit. He, too, had to carry out the
anointing of Hazael and Jehu. "He was still less
capable than Elijah," says Ewald, "of inaugurating a
purely benign and constructive mode of action, since
at that time the whole spirit of the ancient religion
was still unprepared for it."</p>

<p>Elijah found him in the heritage of his fathers,
ploughing the rich level land with twelve yoke of oxen.
Eleven were with his servants, and he himself guided
the twelfth.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> Elijah must have felt that the youth
would have to make a great earthly sacrifice, if he left
all this&mdash;father and mother and home and lands&mdash;to
become the disciple and attendant of a wild, wandering,
and persecuted prophet. He would say nothing to him.
He merely left the high road, and "passed over unto
him," as he plowed his fields.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> Reaching him he took
off his shaggy garment of skin, which, in imitation of
him, became in after years the normal garb of prophets,
and flung it over Elisha's shoulders. This apparently
was all the "anointing" requisite, save such as came
from the Spirit of God. The act had a twofold
symbolism: it meant the adoption of Elisha by Elijah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
to be his "<i>mantelkind</i>," his spiritual son; and it meant
a distinct call to the prophetic office.</p>

<p>At first Elisha seems to have stood still&mdash;amazed,
almost stupefied, by the sudden necessity for so tremendous
a decision. The thought of resigning all the
hopes and comforts of ordinary life and of severing
so many dear and lifelong ties, could not be unmixed
with anguish. Again and again we see in the call
of the prophets this natural shrinking, the human
reluctance born of humility, frailty, and misgiving.
It was so that Moses at the burning bush had at first
fought to the utmost against the conviction of his
destiny. It was so that Gideon had pleaded that he
was but the least of the children of Abiezer. It was
thus that, in later days, Jonah fled from the face of the
Lord to Tarshish; and Isaiah cried, "Woe is me, for I
am a man of unclean lips"; and Jeremiah wailed, "Ah,
Lord God! behold, I cannot speak, for I am a child!"
And if we may allude to modern instances we know
the shrinking hesitations of Luther; and how Cromwell
affirmed that he had prayed to God not to put him
to his terrible work; and how Wesley hesitated long
before he "made himself vile" by preaching in the
open air to the Kingswood colliers; and how Father
Matthew shrank from his great temperance efforts, till
one day, rising from long prayer, and at last convinced
of his destined task, he uttered the homely resolve,
"In the name of God here goes!"</p>

<p>Elisha did not hesitate long. The mysterious Prophet
of Carmel&mdash;he whose voice was believed to have
shut up the heavens, he who had confounded king
and priest and people at Carmel&mdash;had spoken no word.
He had only flung over Elisha the garment of hair,
and then stridden back to the road, and gone on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
way without once looking back. Soon he would have
vanished beyond recall. Elisha decided that he would
obey the call of God; that he would not make "the
great refusal." He ran after Elijah, and overtook him,
and, accepting the position to which he had been
elevated, made but the one human natural request
that he might be suffered first to kiss&mdash;that is, to bid
final farewell to&mdash;his father and mother, and then he
would follow Elijah.</p>

<p>The request has often been compared to that of the
young scribe who said to Jesus, "Lord, suffer me
first to bury my father"; to whom Jesus replied,
"Let the dead bury their dead: follow thou Me." But
the two petitions are not really analogous. The scribe
practically asked that he might stay at home till his
father died; and as that was an uncertain term, and
the ministry of Christ was very brief, the delay was
incompatible with such discipleship as Christ then
required. There was no such indefinite postponement
in Elisha's petition. It showed in him a tender heart,
not a reluctant purpose or a wavering will.</p>

<p>"Go back again," answered Elijah; "for what have
I done to thee?"</p>

<p>The words are often explained as a veiled yet severe
rebuke, as though Elijah had meant to say with scorn,
"Go back; perhaps you are not fit for the high call;
you do not understand the significance of what I have
done;" or, at any rate, "Go back; yet beware of being
softly led away from the path of duty; for consider how
deep is the meaning of what I have done to thee."</p>

<p>The words involve no such disapprobation, nor does
the context agree with that view of them. I can
detect no accent of reproof in the words. Elijah, as
is shown by several incidents in his career, had room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
for tenderness and human affection in his rugged lonely
heart. I understand his reply to mean, "Go back; it
is right, it is natural that thou shouldst thus bid a last
farewell before leaving thy home. Thy coming to me
must be purely voluntary; I have but cast my mantle
over thee, nothing more. Thine own conscience alone
can interpret the full meaning of the act, and God will
make thy way clear before thy face."</p>

<p>Such, I believe, was Elijah's free permission. He
was no hard Stoic, unnaturally trampling on the
sweet affections of the soul. He was no despotic
spiritual guide full of gloomy superstition, like the
grim Spaniard, Ignatius Loyola, who seemed to hold
that God liked even our needless anguish, and our
voluntary self-tortures as an acceptable sacrifice to
Himself. When St. Francis Xavier, on the journey
of the first Jesuits to Rome, passed quite near the
castle of his parents and ancestors, the teachings of
Loyola would not suffer the young noble to turn aside
to print one last kiss upon his mother's cheek. Such
hard exactions belong to that sphere of will-worship and
voluntary humility which St. Paul condemns. Excessive
violence needlessly inflicted on our innocent affections
finds no sanction either in ancient Judaism or genuine
Christianity.</p>

<p>And it was thus that Elisha understood the Prophet.
He went back, and kissed his father and mother, and,
like Matthew when he left his toll-booth to follow
Christ, he made a great feast to his dependents, kinsfolk,
and friends. To mark his complete severance
from the happy past he unyoked his pair of oxen, slew
them, used the plough and goad and wooden yokes
as fuel, boiled the flesh of the oxen, and invited the
people to his farewell feast. Then he arose, and went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
after Elijah, and ministered unto him. He was thenceforth
recognised as a son of the prophetic schools, and
as their future head. For the present he became known
as "Elisha, who poured water on the hands of Elijah."
His subsequent career belongs entirely to the Second
Book of Kings.</p>

<h3><i>AHAB AND BENHADAD.</i></h3>

<p class="center">1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> xx. 1-30.</p>


<p>In the Septuagint and in Josephus the events
narrated in the twentieth chapter of the Book of
Kings are placed after the meeting of Elijah with Ahab
at the door of Naboth's vineyard, which occupies the
twenty-first chapter in our version. This order of
events seems the more probable, but no chronological
data are given us in the long but fragmentary details
of Ahab's reign. They are, in fact, composed of different
sets of records, partly historical, partly prophetic, and
partly taken from some special monograph on the
career of Elijah. Here, too, we may observe that some
most important details are altogether omitted, and that
we only learn them (1) from the inscription of King
Mesha, and (2) from the clay tablets of Assyria.</p>

<p>1. As regards King Mesha, the monument containing
his very interesting annals is generally known as The
Moabite Stone. It is a stele of black basalt, 3 feet
10 inches high, 2 feet broad, 14&frac12; inches thick, rounded
at the top and bottom almost into a semicircle. The
Ph&#339;nician inscription is of capital importance both for
philology and history. It was first discovered by Mr.
Klein, the German missionary of an English society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
at Dibon, east of the Dead Sea, and it is now at the
Louvre. Dibon is now Dibbân.</p>

<p>Mr. Klein in 1868, at Jerusalem, informed Professor
Petermann of Berlin of the existence of this ancient relic,
and from a few letters of the thirty-four lines which he
had copied the Professor at once pronounced that the
language employed was Ph&#339;nician. When M. Clermont
Ganneau, the French consul at Jerusalem, endeavoured
to get possession of it, the Bedawin discovered that it
was regarded with deep interest by European scholars.
They immediately began to quarrel over its possession,
and the Arab who had been sent to copy it barely
escaped with his life. In their greed and jealousy these
modern Moabites "sooner than give it up, put a fire
under it, and threw cold water on it, and so broke it,
and then distributed the bits among the different
families to be placed in the granaries and to serve as
blessings upon the corn; for they said that without the
stone (or its equivalent in hard cash) a blight would
fall upon their crops." Squeezes had been previously
taken from it by M. Ganneau and Captain Warren,
from which the text has been restored.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a></p>

successors.</p>

<p>(2) Lines 21-31. Public works of Mesha after his

<p>(3) Lines 31-34. His successful wars against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
Edomites (or a people of Horonaim), undertaken by

<p>"(1) I, Mesha, am son of Chemosh-Gad,<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> King of
Moab, (2) the Dibonite. My father reigned over Moab
30 years, and I reigned (3) after my father. And I
erected this Stone to Chemosh (a stone of salvation),<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>
(4) for he saved me from all despoilers, and let me see
my desire upon all my enemies. (5) Now Omri, King
of Israel, he oppressed Moab many days, for Chemosh
was angry with his (6) land. His son succeeded him,
and he also said, I will oppress Moab. In my days
he said (Let us go) (7) and I will see my desire on
him and his house, and Israel said, I shall destroy
it for ever. Now Omri took the land (8) Medeba, and
(the enemy) occupied it (in his days and in) the days
of his sons, forty years. And Chemosh (had mercy)
(9) on it in my days."</p>

<p>He goes on to tell how he built Bael Meon and
Kirjathaim; captured Ataroth, and killed all its warriors,
and devoted its spoil to Chemosh. "And Chemosh said
to me, Go take Nebo against Israel." He took it, slew
seven thousand men, devoted the women and maidens
to Ashtar-Chemosh, and offered Jehovah's vessels to
Chemosh. Then he took Jahas which the king of
Israel had fortified, and annexed it to Dibon; built
Korcha, its palaces, prisons, etc., Aroer, Bethbamoth,
and other towns which he colonised with poor Moabites;
and took Horonaim by assault.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span></p>

<p>There the inscription ends, but not until it has given
us some details of a series of bloody wars about which
the Scripture narrative is almost entirely silent, though
in 2 Kings iii. 4-27 it narrates Mesha's desperate
resistance of Israel, Judah, and Edom (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 896).</p>

<p>On this inscription we may briefly remark that for
Chemosh-Gad, Dr. Neubauer reads Chemosh-melech,
and makes various other changes and suggestions.</p>

<p>2. From the annals of Assyria we learn the altogether
unexpected fact that <i>Ahabu Sirlai</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, "Ahab of Israel,"
was acting as one of the allies, or more probably as
one of the vassals, of Syria in the great battle fought at
Karkar, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 854, against Shalmanezer II., by Hittites,
Hamathites, and Syrians. Whether this was before the
invasion of Benhadad, or after his defeat, is uncertain.</p>

<p>The twentieth chapter of the Book of Kings tells
us that Benhadad, the Aramæan king, accompanied by
thirty-two feudatory princes of Hittites, Hamathites,
and others, gathered together all his host with his
horses and chariots, and proclaimed war against Israel.
Unable to meet this vast army in the field, Ahab shut
himself up in Samaria, and Benhadad went up and
besieged it. We do not know which Benhadad this
was. It could not have been the grandson of Rezon,
whom, fourteen years earlier, King Asa had bribed to
attack Baasha in order to divert him from building
Ramah.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> It may have been his son or grandson bearing
the same religious dynastic name. In any case the
policy of attacking Israel was suicidal. If the kings
had possessed the prescient glance of the prophets
they could not have failed to see on the northern
horizon the cloud of Assyrian power, which menaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
them all with cruel extinction at the hands of that
atrocious people. Their true policy would have been
to form an offensive and defensive league, instead of
coveting one another's dominions. Although Assyria
had not yet risen to the zenith of her empire, she
was already formidable enough to convince the King of
Damascus that he would never be able single-handed
to prevent Syria from being crushed before her. Instead
of inflicting ruinous losses and humiliations on the
tribes of Israel, the dynasty of Rezon, if it had been
wise in its day, would have insured their friendly aid
against the horrible common enemy of the nations.</p>

<p>When Benhadad had succeeded in reducing Ahab
to hopeless straits, he sent him a herald to demand
the admission of ambassadors. Their ultimatum was
couched in language of the deadliest insult. Benhadad
laid insolent claim to everything which Ahab possessed&mdash;his
silver, his gold, his wives, and the fairest of his
children. To save his people from ruin, Ahab&mdash;it
is strange that throughout the narrative we do not
hear one word either about Jezebel or Elijah&mdash;sent
an answer of the humblest submission. Tyre gave
him no help, nor did Judah. He seems at this time
to have been entirely isolated and to have sunk to
the nadir of his degradation. "It is true," he said,
"my lord, and king; I, and all that I possess, is
thine." The depth of humiliation involved in such
a concession is the measure of the utter straits to
which Ahab was reduced. When an Eastern king had
to give up to his conqueror even his seraglio&mdash;yes, even
his queen&mdash;all his power must have been humbled to
the very dust. And at the head of Ahab's seraglio
was Jezebel. How frenzied must have been the
thoughts of that terrible woman, when she saw that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
her Baal, and the Astarte to whom her father was a
priest, in spite of the temple which she had built, and
her eight hundred and fifty priests of Baal and Asherah
with all their vestments and pompous ceremonies and
blood-stained invocations, had wholly failed to save
her&mdash;a great king's daughter and a great king's wife&mdash;from
drinking to the very dregs this cup of shame!</p>

<p>Encouraged by this abject demeanour into yet more
outrageous insolence, Benhadad sent back his ambassadors
with the further menace that he would himself
send his messengers next day into Samaria, who should
search and rifle not only the palace of Ahab, but the
houses of all his servants, from which they should take
away everything that was pleasant in their eyes.</p>

<p>The merciless demand kindled in the breast of the
wretched king one last spark of the courage of despair.
Nothing could be worse than such a pillage. Death
itself seemed preferable. He summoned together all
the elders of the land to a great council, to which the
people also were invited, and he set the state of things
before them. The fact gives us an interesting glimpse
into the constitution of the kingdom of Israel. It
greatly resembled that of the little Greek states in the
days of the <i>Iliad</i>. Under ordinary circumstances of
prosperity the king was within certain limits despotic;
but he might easily be reduced to the necessity of
consulting a sort of senate (&#947;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#8055;&#945;), composed of his
greatest subjects,<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> and at these open-air deliberations
the people were present as assessors on whose will
depended the ultimate decision.</p>

<p>Ahab put before his council the desperate condition
to which he had been reduced by the Syrian leaguer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
He recounted the cruel terms to which he had submitted
in order to save his people from destruction.
From the second embassage of Benhadad it was clear
that the first demand had only been made in the hope
that its refusal would give the Syrians an excuse for
pressing on the siege, and delivering the city to ravage
and slaughter. Was it their will that the insolent
foreign tyrant should have his way, and be permitted
without let or hindrance to rifle their houses, and carry
away their goodliest sons as eunuchs and their fairest
wives as concubines? He asked their advice how to
overcome this dire calamity;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What reinforcement we may gain from hope,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">If not what resolution from despair."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The elders saw that even massacre and pillage could
hardly be worse than a tame submission to such
demands. They plucked up courage and said to Ahab,
"Hearken not to him, nor consent"; and the people
shouted their applause to the heroic refusal.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> The king
seems in this instance to have been more despondent
than his subjects, perhaps because he was better able
than they to gauge the immense military superiority
of his invader. Even his second message, though it
rejected Benhadad's demand, was almost pusillanimous
in its submission. With bated breath and whispering
humbleness Ahab said to the Syrian ambassadors, quite
in the tone of a vassal: "Tell my lord the king, I <i>will</i>
submit to his first demands; I <i>may</i> not consent to his
final ones."</p>

<p>The ambassadors went to Benhadad, and returned
with the fierce menace that in the name of his god<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>
their king would shatter Samaria into dust, of which
the handfuls would not suffice for each of his soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a>
Ahab replied firmly in a happy proverb, "Let not him
that girdeth on his armour boast himself as he that
putteth it off."<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></p>

<p>The warning proverb was reported to the Aramæan
king, whilst in the insolent confidence of victory he
was drinking himself drunk in his war-booths.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> It
nettled him to fury. "Plant the engines," he exclaimed.
The catapults and battering-rams,<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> with all the engines
which constituted the siege-train of the day, were at
once set in motion, the scaling ladders brought up, and
the archers set in position, just as we see in the
Assyrian Kouyunjik sculptures of the siege of Lachish
and other cities by Sennacherib.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a></p>

<p>Ahab's heart must have sunk within him, for he
knew his impotence, and he knew also the horrors
which befell a city taken after desperate resistance.
But he was not left unencouraged. The characteristic
of the prophets was that dauntless confidence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
Jehovah which so often made a prophet the Tyrtæus
of his native land, unless the land had sunk into utter
apostasy. In this extreme of peril a nameless prophet&mdash;the
Rabbis, who always guess at a name when they
can, say it was Micaiah ben Imlah&mdash;came to Ahab.
As though to emphasise the supernatural character
of his communication, he pointed to the chariots and
archers and the Syrian host&mdash;which, if the subsequent
numbers be accurate, must have reached the astounding
total of one hundred and thirty thousand men&mdash;and
said, in the name of Jehovah:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Hast thou seen all this great multitude?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Lo! I will deliver it into thine hand to-day:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And thou shalt know that I am the Lord."</span><br />
</p>

<p>"By whom?" was the astonished and half-despairing
question of the king; and the strange answer was:&mdash;</p>

<p>"By the young servants<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> of the provincial governors."</p>

<p>It was to be made clear that this was a victory due to
the intervention of God, and not won by the power nor
the might of man, lest the warriors of Israel should be
able to boast of the arm of flesh.</p>

<p>"Who shall lead the assault?" asked the king.</p>

<p>"Thou!" answered the prophet.</p>

<p>Nothing could be wiser than this counsel, now that
the nation was brought to the extreme edge of hazard.
The veterans, perhaps, were intimidated. They would
see more clearly the hopelessness of attempting to cope
with that colossal host under its five-and-thirty kings.
But now the nation, whose veterans had been driven
back, evoked the battle-brunt of its youths. The two
hundred and thirty-two pages of the district governors
were ready to obey orders, ready, like an army of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
Decii to devote their lives to the cause of their country.
They were put in the forefront of the battle, and so
pitiable was the depression of the capital that Ahab
could only number a paltry army of seven thousand
soldiers to stand behind their desperate undertaking.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

<p>Their plan was well laid. They went out at noon.
At that burning hour, under the intolerable glare and
heat of the Syrian sun&mdash;and campaigns were only
undertaken in spring and summer&mdash;it is almost impossible
to bear the weight of armour, or to sit on horseback,
or to endure the fierce heat of iron chariots.
The first little army which issued from the gates of
Samaria might rely on the effects of a surprise.
Thousands of the Syrian soldiers expecting nothing
less than a battle would be unarmed, and taking their
siesta. Their chariots and war steeds would be
unharnessed and unprepared.</p>

<p>Benhadad was still continuing his heavy drinking
bout with his vassal princes, and not one of them was
in a condition to give coherent commands. A messenger
announced to the band of royal drunkards that
"men" were come out of Samaria. They were too
few to call them "an army," and the notion of an
attack from that poor handful seemed ridiculous.
Benhadad thought they were coming to sue for peace,
but whether peace or war were their object he gave the
contemptuous order to "take them alive."</p>

<p>It was easier said than done. Led by the king at
the head of his valorous youths the little host clashed
into the midst of the unwieldly, unprepared, ill-handled
Syrian host, and by their first slaughter created one of
those fearful panics which have often been the destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
of Eastern hosts. The Syrians, whose army was
made up of heterogeneous forces, and which could not
be managed by thirty-four half-intoxicated feudatories
of differing interests and insecure allegiance, was doubtless
afraid that internal treachery must have been at
work. Like the Midianites, like Zerah's Ethiopian
host, like the Edomites in the Valley of Salt, like the
Ammonites and Moabites in the wilderness of Tekoa,
like the army of Sennacherib, like the enormous and
motley hosts of Persia at Marathon, at Platæa, and at
Arbela, they were instantly flung into irremediable
confusion which tended every moment to be more fatal
to itself. The little band of the youths and horses of
Israel had nothing to do but to slay, and slay, and slay.<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>
No effective resistance was even attempted. Long
before evening the hundred and thirty thousand Syrians,
with the entangled mass of their chariots and horsemen,
were in headlong flight, while Ahab and the people
of Israel slaughtered their flying rear. The defeat
became an absolute rout. Benhadad himself had a
most narrow escape. He could not even wait for his
war chariot. He had to fly with a few of his horsemen,
and apparently, so the words may imply, on an
inferior horse.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></p>

<p>What effect was produced on the national mind and
on the social religion by this immense deliverance we
are not told. Never, certainly, had any nation deeper
cause for gratitude to its religious teachers, who alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
had not despaired of the commonwealth when everything
seemed lost. We would fain know where was
Elijah at this crisis, and whether he took any part
in it. We cannot tell, but we know that as a rule
the sons of the prophets acted together under their
chiefs, and that individual impulses were rarely encouraged.
The very meaning of the "Schools of the
Prophets" was that they were all trained to adopt
the same principles and to move together as one body.</p>

<p>The service rendered by this prophet, whose very
name has been buried in undeserved oblivion, did not
end here. Perhaps he saw signs of carelessness and
undue exultation. He went again to the king, and
warned him that his victory, immense as it had been,
was not final. It was no time for him to settle on his
lees. The Syrians would assuredly return the following
year,<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> probably with increased resources, and with
the burning determination to avenge their defeat. Let
Ahab look well to his army and his fortresses, and
prepare himself for the coming shock!</p>

<h3><i>AHAB'S INFATUATION.</i></h3>

<p class="center">1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> xx. 31-43.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Quem vult Deus perire dementat prius."</p></blockquote>


<p>The courtiers of Benhadad found it easy to flatter
his pride by furnishing reasons to account for
such an alarming overthrow. They had attacked the
Israelites on their hills, and the gods of Israel were
hill-gods. Next time they would take Israel at a
disadvantage by fighting only on the plain. Further,
the vassal kings were only an element of dissension
and weakness. They prevented the handling of the
army as one strong machine worked by a single supreme
will. Let Benhadad depose from command these
incapable weaklings, and put in their place dependent
civil officers (<i>pachoth</i>) who would have no thought but
to obey orders.<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> And so, with good heart, let the king
collect a fresh army with horses and chariots as
powerful as the last. The issue would be certain
conquest and dear revenge.</p>

<p>Benhadad followed this advice. The next year he
went with his new host and encamped near Aphek.
There is an Aphek (now Fîk) which lay on the road
between Damascus on the east of Jordan on a little
plain south-east of the Sea of Galilee. This may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
been the town of Issachar, in the valley of Jezreel,
where Saul was defeated by the Philistines (1 Sam.
xxix. 1). Israel went out to meet them duly provisioned.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>
The Syrian host spread over the whole country; the
Israelite army looked only like two little flocks of kids.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></p>

<p>To strengthen the misgivings of the anxious king
of Israel, another nameless prophet&mdash;probably, like
Elijah, a Gileadite&mdash;came to promise him the victory.
Jehovah would convince the Syrians that He was
something more than a mere local god of the hills
as they had blasphemously said, and Israel would
once more be shown that He was indeed the Lord.</p>

<p>For seven days the vast army and the little band
of patriots gazed at each other, as the Israelites and
Philistines had done in the days of Saul and Goliath.
On the seventh day they joined battle. In what special
way the aid of Jehovah seconded the desperate valour
of His people who were fighting for their all we do
not know, but the result was, once more, their stupendous
victory. The army of the Syrians was not
only defeated, but practically annihilated. In round
numbers 100,000 Syrians fell in the slaughter of that
day, and when the remnant took refuge in Aphek,
which they had captured, they perished in a sudden
crash&mdash;perhaps of earthquake&mdash;which buried them in
the ruins of its fortifications.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> Rescued, we know not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
how, from this disaster, Benhadad fled from chamber
to chamber<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> to hide himself from the victors in some
innermost recess.</p>

<p>But it was impossible that he should not be discovered,
and therefore his servants persuaded him to
throw himself on the mercy of his conqueror. "The
kings of Israel," they said, "are, as we have heard,
compassionate kings; let us go before the king with
sackcloth on our loins, and ropes round our necks, and
ask if he will save thy life."</p>

<p>So they went, as the burghers of Calais went before
Edward I.; and then Ahab heard from the ambassadors
of the king who had once dictated terms to him with
such infinite contempt, the message: "Thy slave Benhadad
saith, I pray thee, let me live."</p>

<p>The incident that followed is eminently characteristic
of Eastern customs. In <i>rencontres</i> between Orientals
everything depends on the first words which are exchanged.
It is believed that superior powers wield the
utterances of the tongue amid the chances which are
really destiny, so that the most casual expression is
caught up superstitiously as a sort of Bath Kol, or
"the daughter of a voice," which not only indicates but
even helps to bring about the purposes of Heaven. A
chance friendly greeting may become the termination
of a blood feud, because something more than chance
is supposed to be behind it!<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> Once when a group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
of doomed gladiators gathered themselves under the
Imperial <i>podium</i> of the amphitheatre with their sublimely
monotonous chant, "<i>Ave Cæsar, morituri te salutamus</i>,"
the half-dazed emperor inadvertently answered, "<i>Avete
vos!</i>" "He has bidden us, 'Hail!'" shouted the
gladiators: "the contest is remitted; we are free!"
Had the Romans been Orientals the twenty thousand
assembled spectators would have felt the force of the
appeal. Even as it was the significance of the omen
was felt to be so great that the gladiators threw down
their arms, and it was only by whips and violence that
they were finally driven to the combat in which they
perished.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a></p>

<p>So with intense eagerness the ambassadors, in their
sackcloth and their halters, awaited the Bath Kol. It
came far more favourably than they had dared to hope.
Surprised, and perhaps half-touched with pity for so
immense a reverse of misfortune, "Is he yet alive?"
exclaimed the careless king: "he is my brother!"</p>

<p>The Syrians snatched at the expression as a decisive
omen.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> It constituted an absolute end of the feud.
It became an implicit promise of that sacred <i>dakheel</i>,
that "protection" to which the slightest and most
accidental expression constitutes a recognised claim.<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a>
"Thy <i>brother</i> Benhadad," they earnestly and emphatically
repeated. In accordance with Eastern custom
and augury their whole end was gained. As far as
Benhadad was concerned he was now safe; as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
Ahab was concerned, the mischief, if mischief it were,
was irreparably done.</p>

<p>Ahab could hardly have drawn back even if he
wished to do so, but perhaps he was swayed by a
fellow feeling for a king. This strange uxorious
monarch, with his easily swayed impulses, his fits of
schoolboy sullenness and swift repentance, his want
of insight into existing conditions, his&mdash;if the expression
may be excused&mdash;happy-go-lucky way of letting
questions settle themselves, was, no doubt, a brave
warrior, but he was a most incapable statesman. His
conduct was perfectly infatuated. Pity is one thing,
but the security of a nation has also to be considered.
It would have been a worse than insensate piece of
pseudo-chivalry if the Congress of Vienna had not sent
Napoleon to Elba, and if England had not confined
him in St. Helena. To set free a man endowed with
passionate hatred, with immense ambitions, with boundless
capacities for mischief&mdash;or only to bind him with
the packthread of insecure promises&mdash;was the conduct
of a fool.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> If it was compassion which induced Ahab
to give Benhadad his life, it showed either gross
incapacity or treachery against his own nation not to
clip his wings, and hamper him from the future injuries
which the burden of gratitude was little likely to prevent.
The sequel shows that Benhadad's resentment against
his royal "brother" only became more hopelessly implacable,
and in all probability it was largely mingled
with contempt.</p>

<p>And Ahab's conduct, besides being foolish, was guilty.
It showed a frivolous non-recognition of his duties as
a theocratic king. It flung away the national advantages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
and even the national security, which had not
been vouchsafed to any power or worth of his, but
only to Jehovah's direct interposition to save the
destinies of his people from premature extinction.</p>

<p>When Benhadad came out of his hiding-place, Ahab,
not content with sparing the life of this furious and
merciless aggressor, took him up into his chariot, which
was the highest honour he could have paid him, and
accepted the excessively easy terms which Benhadad
himself proposed. The Syrians were not required to
pay any indemnity for the immense expenditure and
unutterable misery which their wanton invasions had
inflicted upon Israel! They simply proposed to restore
the cities which Benhadad's father had taken from Omri,
and to allow the Israelites to have a protected bazaar
in Damascus similar to the one which the Syrians
enjoyed in Samaria.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> On this covenant Benhadad was
sent home scatheless, and with a supineness which
was not so much magnanimous as fatuous, Ahab
neglected to take hostages of any kind to secure the
fulfilment even of these ridiculously inadequate terms
of peace.</p>

<p>Benhadad was not likely to throw away the chance
which gave him such an easy-going and improvident
adversary. It is certain that he did not keep the
covenant. He probably never even intended to keep
it. If he condescended to any excuse for breaking it,
he would probably have affected to regard it as extorted
by violence, and therefore invalid, as Francis I. defended
the forfeiture of his parole after the battle of Pavia.
The recklessness with which Ahab had reposed in
Benhadad a confidence, not only undeserved, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
rendered reckless by all the antecedents of the Syrian
king, cost him very dear. He had to pay the penalty of
his dementation three years later in a new and disastrous
war, in the loss of his life, and the overthrow of his
dynasty. The fact that, after so many exertions, and
so much success in war, in commerce, and in worldly
policy, he and his house fell unpitied, and no one raised
a finger in his defence, was doubtless due in part to the
alienation of his army by a carelessness which flung
away in a moment all the fruits of their hard-won
victories.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

<p>There was one aspect in which Ahab's conduct
assumed an aspect more supremely culpable. To
whom had he owed the courage and inspiration which
had rescued him from ruin, and led to the triumphs
which had delivered him and his people from the depths
of despair? Not in the least to himself, or to Jezebel,
or to Baal's priests, or to any of his captains or counsellors.
In both instances the heroism had been inspired
and the success promised by a prophet of Jehovah.
What would convince him, if this would not, that in
God only was his strength? Did not the most
ordinary gratitude as well as the most ordinary
wisdom require that he should recognise the source
of these unhoped-for blessings? There is not the
least trace that he did so. We read of no word of
gratitude to Jehovah, no desire to follow the guidance
of the prophets to whom he was so deeply indebted,
and who had proved their right to be regarded as interpreters
of God's will. Had he done this he would not
have suffered the clannishness of royalty to plunge him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
into a step which was the chief cause of his final
destruction.</p>

<p>He might ignore guidance, but he could not escape
reproof. Again an unknown monitor from the sons
of the prophets was commissioned to bring home to
him his error. He did so by an acted parable, which
gave concrete force and vividness to the lesson which
he desired to convey. Speaking "by the word of
the Lord"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, as a part of the prophetic inspiration
which dictated his acts&mdash;he went to one of his fellows
in the school of which the members are here first
called "the sons of the prophets," and bade him to
wound him. His comrade, not unnaturally, shrank from
obeying so strange a command. It must be borne
in mind that the mere appeal to an inspiration from
Jehovah did not always authenticate itself. Over and
over again in the prophetic books, and in these
histories which the Jews call "the earlier prophets,"
we find that men could profess to act in Jehovah's
name, and even perhaps to be sincere in so doing,
who were mere dupes of their own wills and fancies.
It was, in fact, possible for them to become false
prophets, without always meaning to be so; and these
chances of hallucination&mdash;of being misled by a lying
spirit&mdash;led to fierce contentions in the prophetic communities.
"Since you have not obeyed Jehovah's
voice," said the man, "the lion shall immediately slay
you." "And as soon as he was departed from him
the lion found him and slew him." There is nothing
impossible in the incident, for in those days lions were
common in Palestine, and they multiplied when the
country had been depopulated by war. But we can never
feel certain how far the ethical and didactic and parabolic
elements were allowed, for purposes of edification,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
to play a part in these ancient yet not contemporaneous
<i>Acta Prophetarum</i>, and at any rate to dictate the interpretation
of things which may have actually occurred.</p>

<p>The prophet then bade another comrade to smite
him, and he did so effectually, inflicting a serious
wound.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> This was a part of the intended scene in
which the prophet meant for a moment to play the
<i>rôle</i> of a soldier who had been wounded in the Syrian
war. So he bound up his head with a bandage,<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> and
waited for the king to pass by. An Eastern king is
liable at any time to be appealed to by the humblest
of his subjects, and the prophet stopped Ahab and
stated his imaginary case. "A captain," he said,
"brought me one of his war captives,<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> and ordered
me to keep him safe. If I failed to do so, I was to
pay the forfeit of my life, or to pay as a fine a silver
talent.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> But as I was looking here and there the
captive escaped." "Be it so," answered Ahab; "you
are bound by your own bargain." Thus Ahab, like
David, was led to condemn himself out of his own
mouth. Then the prophet tore the bandage from his
face, and said to Ahab: "Thou art the man! Thus
saith Jehovah, I entrusted to thee the man under my
ban (<i>cherem</i>),<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> and thou hast let him escape. Thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
shalt pay the forfeit. Thy life shall go for his life,
thy people for his people."</p>

<p>Anger and indignation filled the heart of the king; he
went to his house "heavy and displeased." The phrase,
twice applied to him and never used of another, shows
that he was liable to characteristic moods of overwhelming
sullenness, the result of an uneasy conscience,
and of a rage which was compelled to remain impotent.
It is evident that he did not dare to chastise
the audacious offender, though the Jews say that the
prophet was Micaiah, the son of Imlah, and that he
was imprisoned for this offence.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> As a rule the prophets&mdash;like
Samuel and Nathan, and Gad and Shemaiah,
and Jehu the son of Hanani&mdash;were protected
by their sacrosanct position. Now and then an
Urijah, a Jeremiah, a Zechariah son of Berechiah,
paid the penalty of bold denunciation, not only by
hatred and persecution, but with his life. This, however,
was the exception. As a rule the prophets felt
themselves safe under the wing of a Divine protector.
Not only Elijah in his sheepskin mantle, but even the
humblest of his imitators in the prophetic schools might
fearlessly stride up to a king, seize his steed by the
bridle, as Athanasius did to Constantine, and compel
him to listen to his rebuke or his appeal.</p>

<p>The chief glory of the institution of prophecy was
that it rightly estimated the supremacy of the
moral law. The prophets saw that the enforcement
of one precept of righteousness involved more true
religion than hundreds of pages of Levitic ritual. It
is the temptation of priests and Pharisees to sink into
formalism; to warp the conceptions of the Almighty
into that of a Deity who is jealous about inconceivable
pettinesses of ceremonial; to think that the Eternal
cares about niceties of rubric, rules of ablutions, varieties
of nomenclature or organisation. In their solicitude
about these nullities they often forget, as they did in
the days of Christ, the weightier matters of the law,
mercy, judgment, and truth. When religion has been
dwarfed into these inanities the men who deem themselves
its only orthodox votaries, and scorn all others
as "lax" and "latitudinarian," are not only ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
persecute every genuine teacher of righteousness, but
even to murder the Christ Himself. They come to
think that falsehood and cruelty cease to be criminal
when practised in the cause of religious intolerance.</p>

<p>Against all such dwarfing perversion of the conceptions
of the essential service which man owes to God
the prophets were called forth to be in age after age
the energetic remonstrants. It is true that they also
had their own special temptations; they, too, might
become the slaves of shibboleths; they might sink
into a sort of automatic or mechanical form of prophecy
which contented itself with the wearing of garbs and
the repetition of formulæ long after they had become
evacuated of their meaning.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> They might distort the
message "Thus saith Jehovah" to serve their own
ends.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> They might yield to the temptations both of
individual and of corporate ambition. They might
assume the hairy garb and rough locks of Elijah for
the sake of the awe they inspired while their heart
"was not but for their own covetousness."<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> They
might abuse their prestige to promote their own party
or their own interests. They were assailed by the
same perils to which in after days so many monks,
hermits, and religious societies succumbed. Many
a man became a nominal prophet, as many a man
became a monk, because the office secured to him a
maintenance&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Twas not for nothing the good belly-ful,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The warm serge and the rope that goes all round,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And day long blessed idleness besides;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span></p>

<p>and also because it surrounded him with a halo of
imaginary sanctity. The monks, we know, by their
turbulence and partisanship, became the terror of the
fourth century after Christ, and no men more emphatically
denounce their mendicancy and their impostures
than the very fathers who, like St. Jerome and St.
Augustine, were most enamoured of their ideal.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> As
for the hermits, if one of them securely established
a reputation for abnormal austerities he became in his
way as powerful as a king. In the stories even of
such a man as St. Martin of Tours<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> we detect now
and then a gleam of hauteur, of which traces are
not lacking in the stories of these nameless or famous
prophets in the Book of Kings.</p>

<p>No human institution, even if it be avowedly religious,
is safe from the perilous seductions of the world, the
flesh, and the devil. Perpetually</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The old order changeth, giving place to new,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And God fulfils Himself in many ways<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lest one good custom should corrupt the world."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mendicant brotherhoods and ascetic communities
were soon able, by legal fictions, to revel in opulence,
to steep themselves in luxury, and yet to wield a
religious authority which princes envied. When we
read what the Benedictines and the Minorites and
the Carthusians often became, we are the less surprised
to find that even the Schools of the Prophets,
while Elijah and Elisha yet lived, could abdicate as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
body their best functions, and, deceiving and deceived,
could learn to answer erring kings according to their
idols.</p>

<p>But the greatest and truest prophets rose superior
to the influences which tended to debase the vulgar
herd of their followers, in days when prophecy grew
into an institution and the world became content to
side with a church which gave it no trouble and mainly
spoke in its own tones. True prophecy cannot be
made a matter of education, or "tamed out of its
splendid passion." The greatest prophets, like Amos
and Isaiah, did not come out of the Schools of the
Prophets. Inspiration cannot be cultivated, or trained
to grow up a wall. "Much learning," says Heraclitus
very profoundly, "does not teach; but the Sibyl with
maddening lips, uttering things unbeautified, unperfumed,
and unadorned, reaches through myriads of
years because of God." The man whom God has
summoned forth to speak the true word or do the
heroic deed, at the cost of all hatred, or of death itself,
has normally to protest not only against priests, but
against his fellow-prophets also when they immorally
acquiesced in oppression and wrong which custom
sanctioned.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> It was by such true prophets that the
Hebrews and through them the world were taught
the ideal of righteousness. Their greatest service was
to uphold against idolatry, formalism, and worldliness,
the simple standard of the moral law.</p>

<p>It was owing to such teaching that the Israelites
formed a true judgment of Ahab's culpability. The
act which was held to have outweighed all his other
crimes, and to have precipitated his final doom, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
an isolated act of high-handed injustice to an ordinary
citizen.</p>

<p>Ahab was a builder. He had built cities and palaces,
and was specially attached to his palace at Jezreel,
which he wished to make the most delightful of summer
residences. It was unique in its splendour as the first
palace inlaid with ivory. The nation had heard of
Solomon's ivory throne, but never till this time of an
"ivory palace." But a palace is nothing without
pleasant gardens. The neighbourhood of Jezreel, as
is still shown by the ancient winepresses cut out of
the rock in the neighbourhood of its ruins, was
enriched by vineyards, and one of these vineyards
adjoining the palace belonged to a citizen named
Naboth.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> It happened that no other ground would
so well have served the purpose of Ahab to make a
garden near his palace, and he made Naboth a fair
offer for it. "I will give you," he said, "a better
vineyard for it, or I will pay you its full value in ingots
of silver."<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a></p>

<p>Naboth, however, was perfectly within his rights<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> in
rejecting the offer. It was the inheritance of his fathers,
and considerations nothing short of sacred&mdash;considerations
which then or afterwards found a place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
written statutes of the nation&mdash;made it wrong in his
judgment to sell it. He sturdily refused the offer of
the king. His case was different from that of the
Jebusite prince Araunah, who had sold his threshing
floor to David, and that of Shemer, who sold the Hill
of Samaria to Omri.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<p>A sensible man would have accepted the inevitable,
and done the best he could to find a garden elsewhere.
But Ahab, who could not bear to be thwarted, came
into his house "heavy and displeased." Like an overgrown,
sullen boy he flung himself on his divan, turned
his face to the wall, and would not eat.</p>

<p>News came to Jezebel in her seraglio of her lord's
ill-humour, and she came to ask him, "What mutiny
in his spirit made him decline to take food?"<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a></p>

<p>He told her the sturdy refusal of Naboth, and she
broke into a scornful laugh. "Are you King of Israel?"
she asked. "Why this is playing at kinghood!<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> It is
not the way we do things in Tyre. Arise, eat bread,
be merry. <i>I</i> will give thee the vineyard of Naboth
the Jezreelite."</p>

<p>Did he admire the mannish spirit of the Syrian
princess, or did he secretly shrink from it? At any
rate he let Jezebel take her own course. With intrepid
insolence she at once wrote a letter in Ahab's name
from Samaria, and sent it sealed with his signet to the
elders of Jezreel.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> She ordered them to proclaim a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
fast as though to avert some public calamity, and&mdash;with
a touch of dreadful malice as though to aggravate
the horror of his ruin&mdash;to exalt Naboth to a conspicuous
position in the assembly.<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> They were to get
hold of two "sons of worthlessness," professional perjurers,
and to accuse Naboth of blasphemy against God
and the king.<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> His mode of refusing the vineyard
might give some colourable pretext to the charge.
On the testimony of those two false witnesses Naboth
must be condemned, and then they must drag him
outside the city to the pool or tank with his sons and
stone them all.</p>

<p>Everything was done by the subservient elders of
Jezreel exactly as she had directed. Their fawning
readiness to carry out her vile commands is the deadliest
incidental proof of the corruption which she and
her crew of alien idolaters had wrought in Israel. On
that very evening Jezebel received the message, "Naboth
is stoned and is dead." By the savage law of those
days his innocent sons were involved in his overthrow,<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a>
and his property, left without heirs, reverted by confiscation
to the crown.<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> "Arise," said the triumphant
sorceress, "and take possession of the vineyard you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
wished for. I have given it to you as I promised.
Its owner and his sons have died the deaths of blasphemers,
and he crushed under the stones outside
Jezreel."</p>

<p>Caring only for the gratification of his wish, heedless
of the means employed, hastily and joyously at early
dawn the king arose to seize the coveted vineyard.
The dark deed had been done at night, the king was
alert with the morning light.<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> He rode in his chariot
from Samaria to Jezreel, which is but seven miles
distant, and he rode in something of military state, for
in separate chariots, or else riding in the same chariot,
behind him were two war-like youths, Jehu and Bidkar,
who were destined to remember the events of that day,
and to refer to them four years afterwards, when one
had become king and the other his chief commander.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a></p>

<p>But the king's joy was shortlived!</p>

<p>News of the black crime had come to Elijah, probably
in his lonely retreat in some cave at Carmel. He was
a man who, though he flamed out on great occasions
like a meteor portending ruin to the guilty, yet lived
in general a hidden life. Six years had elapsed since
the calling of Elisha, and we have not once been
reminded of his existence. But now he was instantly
inspired to protest against the atrocious act of robbery
and oppression, and to denounce upon it an awful
retribution which not even Baal-worship had called
forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span></p>

<p>Ahab was at the summit of his hopes. He was
about to complete his summer palace and to grasp the
fruits of the crime which he had allowed the &#7936;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#8057;&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#957;
&#954;&#949;&#8048;&#961; of his wife to commit. But at the gate of Naboth's
vineyard stood the swart figure of the Prophet in his
hairy garb. We can imagine the revulsion of feeling
which drove the blood to the king's heart as he
instantly felt that he had sinned in vain. The advantage
of his crime was snatched from him at the instant
of fruition. Half in anger, half in anguish, he cried,
"Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?"</p>

<p>"I have found thee," said the Prophet, speaking in
Jehovah's name. "Thou hast sold thyself to work
evil before me, and I will requite it and extinguish thee
before me. Surely the Lord saw yesternight the blood
of Naboth and the blood of his sons.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> Thy dynasty
shall be cut off to the last man, like that of Jeroboam,
like that of Baasha. Where the dogs licked the blood
of Naboth, the dogs shall lick thine. The harlots shall
wash themselves in the water which thy blood has
stained. Him that dieth of thee in the city the dogs
shall eat, and him that dieth in the field shall the
vultures rend, and the dogs shall eat Jezebel also in the
moat of Jezreel."<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a></p>

<p>It is the duty of prophets to stand before kings and
not be ashamed. So had Abraham stood before Nimrod,
and Moses before Pharaoh, and Samuel before Saul,
and Nathan before David, and Iddo before Jeroboam.
So was Isaiah to stand hereafter before Ahaz, and
Jeremiah before Jehoiachin, and John the Baptist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
before Herod, and Paul before Nero. Nor has it been
at all otherwise in modern days. So did St. Ignatius
confront Trajan, and St. Ambrose brave the Empress
Justina, and St. Martin the Usurper Maximus, and
St. Chrysostom the fierce Eudoxia, and St. Basil the
heretic Valens, and St. Columban the savage Thierry,
and St. Dunstan our half-barbarous Edgar. So, too,
in later days, Savonarola could speak the bare bold
truth to Lorenzo the Magnificent, and Knox to Mary
Queen of Scots, and Bishop Ken to Charles II. But
never was any king confronted by so awful a denunciation
of doom. Probably the moment that Elijah had
uttered it he disappeared; but could not a swift arrow
have reached him from Jehu's or Bidkar's bow? We
know how they remembered two reigns later the
thunder of those awful words, but they would hardly
have disobeyed the mandate of their king had he bidden
them to seize or slay the Prophet. Nothing was further
from their thoughts. Elijah had become to Ahab the
incarnation of his own awakened conscience, and it
spoke to him in the thunders of Sinai. He quailed
before the tremendous imprecation. We may well
doubt whether he even so much as entered again the
vineyard of Naboth; never certainly could he have
enjoyed it. He had indeed sold himself to do evil,
and, as always happens to such colossal criminals,
he had sold himself for naught&mdash;as Achan did for a
buried robe and a useless ingot, and Judas for the
thirty pieces of silver which he could only dash down
on the Temple floor. Ahab turned away from the
vineyard, which might well seem to him haunted by
the ghosts of his murdered victims and its clusters full
of blood. He rent his clothes, and clad himself in
sackcloth, and slept in sackcloth, and went about barefooted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
with slow steps<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> and bent brow, a stricken man.
Thenceforward as long as he lived he kept in penitence
and humiliation the anniversary of Naboth's death,<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> as
James IV. of Scotland kept the anniversary of the
death of the father against whom he had rebelled.</p>

<p>This penitence, though it does not seem to have been
lasting, was not wholly in vain. Elijah received a Divine
intimation that, because the king troubled himself, the
threatened evil should in part be postponed to the days
of his sons. The sun of the unfortunate and miserable
dynasty set in blood. But though it is recorded that,
incited by his Tyrian wife, he did very abominably in
worshipping "idol-blocks," and following the ways of
the old Canaanite inhabitants of the land, none of his
crimes left a deeper brand upon his memory than the
judicial seizure of the vineyard which he had coveted
and the judicial murder of Naboth and his sons.</p>

<p>How adamantine, how irreversible is the law of
retribution! With what normal and natural development,
apart from every arbitrary infliction, is the
irrevocable prophecy fulfilled: "Be sure your sin will
find you out."</p>

</div></div>

<p>Ahab had to be taught by adversity since he refused
the lesson of prosperity.</p>

<p>But as for Elijah himself, he once more vanished into
the solitude of his own life, and we do not hear of him
again till four years later, when he sent to Ahaziah, the
son of Ahab, the message of his doom.</p>

<p>We now come to the last scene of Ahab's troubled
and eventful life. His two immense victories
over the Syrians had secured for his harassed kingdom
three years of peace, but at the end of that time he
began to be convinced that the insecure conditions
upon which he had weakly set Benhadad free would
never be ratified. The town of Ramoth in Gilead,
which was one of great importance as a frontier town
of Israel, had, in express defiance of the covenant, been
retained by the Syrians, who still refused to give it up.
A favourable opportunity, he thought, had now occurred
to demand its cession.</p>

<p>This was the friendly visit of Jehoshaphat, King of
Judah. It was the first time that a king of Judah had
visited the capital of the kings who had revolted from
the dynasty of David. It was the first acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
close of the old blood-feuds, and the beginning of a
friendship and affinity which policy seemed to dictate.
After all Ephraim and Judah were brothers, though
Ephraim had vexed Judah, and Judah hated Ephraim.
Jehoshaphat was rich, prosperous, successful in war.
No king since Solomon had attained to anything like
his greatness&mdash;the reward, it was believed, of his piety
and faithfulness. Ahab, too, had proved himself a
successful warrior, and the valour of Israel's hosts had,
with Jehovah's blessing, extricated their afflicted land
from the terrible aggressions of Syria. But how could
the little kingdom of Israel hope to hold out against
Syria, and to keep Moab in subjection? How could
the still smaller and weaker kingdom of Judah keep
itself from vassalage to Egypt and from the encroachments
of Philistines on the west and Moabites on the
east? Could anything but ruin be imminent, if these
two nations of Israel and Judah&mdash;one in land, one in
blood, one in language, in tradition, and in interests&mdash;were
perpetually to destroy each other with internecine
strife? The kings determined to make a league with
one another, and to bind it by mutual affinity. It was
proposed that Athaliah, daughter of Ahab and Jezebel,
should marry Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat.</p>

<p>The dates are uncertain, but it was probably in
connexion with the marriage contract that Jehoshaphat
now paid a ceremonial visit to Ahab. The King of
Israel received him with splendid entertainments to all
the people.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> Ahab had already broached to his captains
the subject of recovering Ramoth Gilead, and he now
took occasion of the King of Judah's visit to invite his
co-operation. What advantages and compensations
he offered are not stated. It may have been enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
to point out that, if Syria once succeeded in crushing
Israel, the fate of Judah would not be long postponed.
Jehoshaphat, who seems to have been too ready to
yield to pressure, answered in a sort of set phrase: "I
am as thou art; my people as thy people; my horses
as thy horses."<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a></p>

<p>But it is probable that his heart misgave him. He
was a truly pious king. He had swept the Asherahs
out of Judah, and endeavoured to train his people in the
principles of righteousness and the worship of Jehovah.
In joining Ahab there must have been in his conscience
some unformulated murmur of the reproof which on his
return to Jerusalem was addressed to him by Jehu, the
son of Hanani, "Shouldst thou help the ungodly, and
love them that hate the Lord? Therefore is wrath
upon thee from the Lord." But at the beginning of
a momentous undertaking he would not be likely to
imitate the godless indifference which had led Ahab to
take the most fatal steps without seeking the guidance
of God. He therefore said to Ahab, "Inquire, I pray
thee, of the word of the Lord to-day."</p>

<p>Ahab could not refuse, and apparently the professional
prophets of the schools had been pretty well
cajoled or drilled into accordance with his wishes. A
great and solemn assembly was summoned. The kings
had clothed themselves in their royal robes striped
with laticlaves of Tyrian purple,<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> and sat on thrones
in an open space before the gate of Samaria. No less
than four hundred prophets of Jehovah were summoned
to prophesy before them. Ahab propounded for their
decision the formal and important question, "Shall I
go up to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span></p>

<p>With one voice the prophets "philippised." They
answered the king according to his idols. Had the
gold of Ahab or of Jezebel been at work among them?
Had they been in king's houses, and succumbed to
courtly influences? Or were they carried away by the
interested enthusiasm of one or two of their leaders
who saw their own account in the matter? Certain
it is that on this occasion they became false prophets.
They used their formula "Thus saith Jehovah" without
authority, and promised Jehovah's aid in vain.<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>
Conspicuous in his evil ardour was one of them named
Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah. To illustrate and emphasise
his jubilant prophecies he had made and affixed
to his head a pair of iron horns; and as though to
symbolise the bull of the House of Ephraim, he said
to Ahab, "Thus saith Jehovah. With these shalt thou
push the Assyrians until thou have consumed them."<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>
And all the prophets prophesied so.</p>

<p>What could be more encouraging? Here was a
patriot-king, the hero-victor in great battles, bound
by fresh ties of kinship and league with the pious
descendant of David, meditating a just raid against a
dangerous enemy to recover a frontier-fortress which
was his by right; and here were four hundred
prophets&mdash;not Asherah-prophets or Baal-prophets, but
genuine prophets of Jehovah&mdash;unanimous, and even
enthusiastic, in approving his design and promising him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
the victory! The Church and the world were&mdash;as
they so often have been&mdash;delightfully at one.</p>

<p>"One with God" is the better majority. These
loud-voiced majorities and unanimities are rarely to
be trusted. Truth and righteousness are far more
often to be found in the causes which they denounce
and at which they sneer. They silence opposition,
but they produce no conviction. They can torture,
but they cannot refute. There is something unmistakable
in the accent of sincerity, and it was lacking
in the voice of these prophets on the popular side.
If Ahab was deceived and even carried away by
the unwonted approval of so many messengers of
Jehovah, Jehoshaphat was not. These four hundred
prophets who seemed superfluously sufficient to Ahab
by no means satisfied the King of Judah.</p>

<p>"Is there not," he asked, with uneasy misgiving,
"one prophet of the Lord besides, that we might
inquire of him?"</p>

<p>One prophet of the Lord besides?<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> Were not,
then, <i>four hundred</i> prophets of the Lord enough? They
must have felt themselves cruelly slighted when
they heard the pious king's inquiry, and doubtless a
murmur of disapproval arose amongst them.</p>

<p>And the King of Israel said, "There is yet one man."
Had Jehoshaphat been secretly thinking of Elijah?
Where was Elijah? He was living, certainly, for he
survived even into the reign (apparently) of Jehoram.
But where was Elijah? If Jehoshaphat had thought
of him, Ahab at any rate did not care to mention him.
Perhaps he was inaccessible, in some lonely unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
retreat of Carmel or of Gilead. Since his fearful
message to Ahab he had not been heard of; but why
did he not appear at a national crisis so tremendous
as this?</p>

<p>"There is yet one man," said Ahab. "Micaiah,
the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the
Lord; but"&mdash;such was the king's most singular comment&mdash;"I
hate him; for he doth not prophesy good
concerning me, but evil."<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a></p>

<p>It was a weak confession that he was aware of one
man who was indisputably a true prophet of Jehovah,
but whom he had purposely excluded from this gathering
because he knew that his was an undaunted spirit
which would not consent to shout with the many in
favour of the king. Indeed, it seems probable that he
was, at this moment, in prison. Jewish legend says
that he had been put there because he was the prophet
who had reproved Ahab for his folly in suffering
Benhadad to escape with the mere breath of a general
promise. Till then he had been unknown. He was
not like Elijah, and might safely be suppressed. And
Ahab, as was universally the case in ancient days,
thought that the prophet could practically prophesy
as he liked, and not merely prophesy, but bring about
his own vaticinations. Hence, if a prophet said anything
which he disliked, he regarded him as a personal
enemy, and, if he dared, he punished him&mdash;just as
Agamemnon punished Calchas.</p>

<p>Jehoshaphat, however, was still dissatisfied; he
wanted further confirmation. "Let not the king say
so," he said. If he is a genuine prophet, the king
should not hate him, or fancy that he prophesies evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
out of malice prepense. Would it not be more satisfactory
to hear what he might have to say?</p>

<p>However reluctantly, Ahab saw that he should have
to send for Micaiah, and he despatched a eunuch to
hurry him to the scene with all speed.<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a></p>

<p>The mention of a eunuch as the messenger is significant.
Ahab had become the first polygamist among
the kings of Israel, and a seraglio so large as his<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> could
never be maintained without the presence of these
degraded and odious officials, who here first appear in
the hardier annals of the Northern Kingdom.</p>

<p>This eunuch, however, seems to have had a kindly
disposition. He was good-naturedly anxious that
Micaiah should not get into trouble. He advised him,
with prudential regard for his own interest, to swim
with the stream. "See now," he said, "all the prophets
with one mouth are prophesying good to the king.
Pray agree with them. Do not spoil everything."</p>

<p>How often has the same base advice been given!
How often has it been followed! How certain is its
rejection to lead to bitter animosity! One of the most
difficult lessons of life is to learn to stand alone when
all the prophets are prophesying falsely to please the
rulers of the world. Micaiah rose superior to the
eunuch's temptation. "By Jehovah," he said, "I will
speak only what He bids me speak."</p>

<p>He stood before the kings, the eager multitude, the
unanimous and passionate prophets; and there was
deep silence when Ahab put to him the question to
which the four hundred had already shouted an
affirmative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span></p>

<p>His answer was precisely the same as theirs: "Go
up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper, for the Lord shall
deliver it into the hand of the king!" Every one
must have been astonished. But Ahab detected the
tone of scorn which rang through the assenting words,
and angrily adjured Micaiah to give a true answer in
Jehovah's name. "How many times," he cried, "shall
I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which
is true in Jehovah's name." The "how many times"
shows how faithfully Micaiah must have fulfilled his
duty of speaking messages of God to his erring king.</p>

<p>So adjured, Micaiah could not be silent, however
much the answer might cost him, or however useless
it might be.</p>

<p>"I saw all Israel,"<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> he said, "scattered on the
mountain like sheep without a shepherd. And Jehovah
said, These have no master, let every man return to
his house in peace."</p>

<p>The vision seemed to hint at the death of the king,
and Ahab turned triumphantly to his ally, "Did I
not tell you that he would prophesy evil?"</p>

<p>Micaiah justified himself by a daringly anthropomorphic
apologue which startles us, but would not at
all have startled those who regarded everything as
coming from the immediate action of God, and who
could ask, "Shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord
hath not done it?"<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> The prophets were self-deceived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
but this would be expressed by saying that Jehovah
deceived them. Pharaoh hardens his heart, and God
is said to have done it.</p>

<p>He had seen Jehovah on His throne, he said, surrounded
by the host of heaven, and asking who would
entice Ahab to his fall at Ramoth Gilead. After various
answers the spirit<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> said, "I will go and be a lying
spirit in the mouths of all his prophets, and will entice
him." Then Jehovah sent him, so that they all spoke
good to the king though Jehovah had spoken evil.
God had sent to them all&mdash;king, people, prophets&mdash;strong
delusion that they should believe a lie.</p>

<p>This stern reproof to all the prophets was more than
their coryphæus Zedekiah could endure. Having
recourse to "the syllogism of violence" he strode up to
Micaiah and smote the defenceless, isolated, hated man
on the cheek,<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> with the contemptuous question, "Which
way went the spirit of the Lord from me, to speak unto
thee?"</p>

<p>"Behold thou shalt know," was the answer, "on the
day when thou shalt flee from chamber to chamber to
hide thyself." If the hands of the prophet were bound
as he came from the prison, there would have been an
infinite dignity in that calm rebuke.</p>

<p>But as though the case was self-evident, and Micaiah's
opposition to the four hundred prophets proved his
guilt, Ahab sent him back to prison. "Issue orders,"
he said, "to Amon, governor of the city, and Joash, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
king's son, to feed him scantily on bread and water till
the king's return in peace."</p>

<p>"If thou return at all in peace," said Micaiah,
"Jehovah hath not spoken by me."<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a></p>

<p>It is a sign of the extreme fragmentariness of the
narrative that of Micaiah and Zedekiah we hear nothing
further, though the sequel respecting them must have
been told in the original record. But the prophecy of
Micaiah came true, and the unanimous four hundred
had prophesied lies. There are times when "the
Catholic Church" dwindles down to the one man and
the small handful of those who speak the truth. The
expedition was altogether disastrous. Ahab, perhaps
knowing by spies how bitterly the Syrians were
incensed against him, told Jehoshaphat that he would
disguise himself and go into the battle, but begged his
ally to wear his robes as was usual with kings.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> Benhadad,
with the implacable hatred of one who had
received a benefit, was so eager to be avenged on Ahab
that he had told his thirty-two captains to make his
capture their special aim.<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> Seeing a king in his robes
they made a fierce onset on Jehoshaphat and surrounded
his chariot. His cries for rescue showed them that he
was not Ahab, and they turned away.<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> But Ahab's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
disguise did not save him. A Syrian&mdash;the Jews say
that it was Naaman<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a>&mdash;drew a bow with no particular
aim,<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> and the arrow smote Ahab in the place between
the upper and lower armour.<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> Feeling that the wound
was deadly he ordered his charioteer to turn his hands
and drive him out of the increasing roar of the <i>mêlée</i>.
But he would not wholly leave the fight, and with
heroic fortitude remained standing in his chariot in
spite of agony. All day the blood kept flowing down
into the hollow of the chariot. At evening the Syrians
had to retire in defeat, but Ahab died. The news of
the king's death was proclaimed at sunset by the
herald, and the cry was raised which bade the host
disband and return home.<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a></p>

<p>They carried the king's body back to Samaria, and
they buried it. They washed the blood-stained chariot
in the pool outside the city, and there the dogs licked
the king's blood, and the harlot-votaries of Asherah
bathed in the blood-dyed waters, as Elijah had

his own house. He had winked at the atrocities committed

at her idolatrous innovations, and put no obstacle in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
the way of her persecutions. The people who might
have forgotten or condoned all else never forgot
the stoning and spoliation of Naboth and his sons,
and his death was regarded as a retribution on this
crime.</p>

<h3><i>CONCLUSION.</i></h3>


<p>It will have been seen that there are two main
heroes of the First Book of Kings&mdash;Solomon and
Elijah. How vast is the gulf which separates those
two ideals! In Solomon we see man in all the adventitious
splendour which he can derive from magnificent
surroundings and from exaltation to a dizzy height
above his fellows. Everything that the earth can give
him he possesses from earliest youth, yet all turns to
dust and ashes under his touch. Wealth, rank, power,
splendour cannot ever, or under any circumstances,
satisfy the soul. The soul can only be sustained by
heavenly food, by the manna which God sends it from
heaven in the wilderness. Its divineness can only be
maintained by feeding on the Divine. If we think of
Solomon, even in his most dazzling hour, we see no
element of happiness or of reality in his lonely splendour
or loveless home. It is nothing but a miserable pageant.
The Book of Ecclesiastes, though written centuries after
he had passed away, yet shows sufficiently, as the
Eastern legends also show, that mankind was not
misled by the glamour which surrounded him into
the supposition that he was to be envied. It was
felt, whether he uttered it or not, that "Vanity of
vanities, vanity of vanities, all is vanity," is the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
echo of his weariness. In the famous fiction the
Khaliph sees him with the other giant shades on his
golden throne at the banquet; but each and all have
on their faces an expression of solemn agony, and under
the folds of their purple a little flame is ever burning
at their hearts.</p>

<p>How different is the rough Prophet of Gilead, the
ascetic, in his sheepskin mantle and leathern girdle,
who can live for months on a little water and meal
baked with oil!<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> In him we see the grandeur of
manhood reduced to its simplest elements; we see
the dignity of man as simply man towering over all
the adventitious circumstance of royalty. One who,
like Elijah, has no earthly desires, has no real fears.
If he flies from Jezebel to save his life, it is only
because he is not justified in flinging it away; otherwise
he is as dauntless before the <i>vultus instantis tyranni</i>
as before the <i>civium ardor prava jubentium</i>. Hence,
Elijah in his absolute poverty, in his despised isolation&mdash;Elijah,
hunted and persecuted, and living in dens
and caves of the earth&mdash;is immeasurably greater than
Solomon, because he is the messenger of the living God
before whom he stands. And his work is immeasurably
more permanent and more valuable for humanity than
that of all the kings and great men among whom he
moved. He believed in God, he fought for righteousness,
and therefore he left behind him an unperishable
memorial, showing that he who would live for eternity
rather than for time is he who best achieves the high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
ends of his destiny. He may err as Elijah erred, but
with the blessing of the Lord he shall not miscarry.
Though he go forth weeping, he shall come again with
joy, bringing his sheaves with him. Solomon, after his
death, almost vanished from the history of Israel into
the legends of Arabia. In the New Testament he is
but barely mentioned. But Elijah still lives in, and
haunts, the memory of his nation. A chair is placed
for his invisible presence at every circumcision. A
cup is set aside for him at sacred banquets, and all
dubious questions are postponed for solution "until
the day when Elijah comes." He shone with Moses
on the Mount of Transfiguration; and St. James, the
Lord's brother, appeals to him as the most striking
example of the power of that prayer which</p>

<h2><a name="NOTE_ON_THE_CHRONOLOGY_OF_THE" id="NOTE_ON_THE_CHRONOLOGY_OF_THE">NOTE ON THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE
FIRST BOOK OF KINGS.</a></h2>


<p>I have not thought it worth while to trouble the reader
with conjectures or corrections of the text, intended to
remove the numerous and obvious discrepancies which
the redactor of the Book of Kings leaves uncorrected in
his references to the synchronism of the reigns.<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> Many
of them are removed or modified when we bear in mind
that, <i>e.g.</i>, Nadab and Elah and Ahaziah are described
as reigning "two years" each (xv. 25, xvi. 8, xxii. 51),
whereas the reign of each may not have exceeded a
year, or even a few months, if these months came at
the end of one year and the beginning of another.
Periods of anarchic interregnum, or of association of a
son with his father on the throne, may account for other
confusions and contradictions; but they are purely conjectural,
and in some cases far from probable. Jerome,
as is well known, gave up all attempts to harmonise the
chronologic data as a hopeless problem. "Relege,"
he says, "omnes et veteris et novi Testamenti libros, et
tantam annorum reperies dissonantiam <i>ut hujuscemodi
hærere quæstionibus non tam studiosi quam otiosi hominis
esse videatur</i>."</p>

<p>The Assyrians were, for the most part (though, as
Schrader shows, not <i>always</i>), as scrupulously exact in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
their chronological details as the Jews were careless in
theirs. The cuneiform inscriptions give us the following
data, which may be regarded as <i>points de repère</i>, and
which are not reconcilable with the received dates:&mdash;</p>

<p>From Ph&#339;nician inscriptions (recorded in the <i>Corpus
Inscriptionum Semiticarum</i>) little of <i>historical</i> importance
has hitherto been reaped.</p>

<p>In the Egyptian monuments there is nothing which
illustrates the period of the Kings except the inscription
of Sheshonk recording his invasion in the days
of Rehoboam, of which I have given some account
(p. <a href="#Page_315">315</a>).</p>

<p>The Assyrian inscriptions, to which allusion is made
in their place, are of extreme importance and interest,
and from the lists of kings we have good details of
chronology. The best book on their bearing upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
Hebrew history is that of Schrader, <i>Die Keilinschriften
und d. Alte Testament</i>, 1883.</p>

<p>On the datum of four hundred and eighty years from
the Exodus to the building of the Temple, I have already
touched. It does not agree with Acts xiii. 20, nor with
the Book of Judges. The LXX. reads "four hundred
and forty." It is almost certainly a late and erroneous
chronological gloss derived in very simple fashion, thus:&mdash;The
wanderings forty years, Joshua forty years,
Othniel forty years, Ehud eighty years, Jabin twenty
years, Barak forty years, Gideon forty years, the Philistines
forty years, Samson twenty years, Samuel forty
years, Saul forty years, David forty years = four hundred
and eighty, or twelve generations of forty years.</p>

<p>But the same result was arrived at with equal empiricism
by omitting the episodes of heathen dominations
(Jabin and the Philistines), and only adding up the
years assigned to the Judges, and the four years of
Solomon's reign before he began to build the Temple,
thus:&mdash;Othniel forty years, Ehud eighty years, Barak
forty years, Gideon forty years, Tola twenty-three years,
Jair twenty-two years, Jephthah six years, Ibzan seven
years, Elom ten years, Abdon eight years, Samson
twenty years = two hundred and ninety-six.</p>

<p>Eli forty years, Samuel twenty years (1 Sam. vii. 15),
David forty years, Solomon four = one hundred and
four. Add to the four hundred the two generations
of the wanderings and Joshua, and we again have four
hundred and eighty; but quite as arbitrarily, for the
period of Saul is omitted.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a></p>

<p>The problems of early Hebrew chronology cannot
yet be regarded as even approximately solved.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> "In der Chronik," on the other hand, "ist es der Pentateuch, d.h.
vor Allem der <i>Priestercodex</i>, nach dessen Muster die Geschichte des
alten Israels dargestellt wird" (Wellhausen, <i>Prolegom.</i>, p. 309). It has
been said that the Book of Kings reflects the political and prophetic
view, and the Book of Chronicles the priestly view of Jewish history.
It is about the Pentateuch, its date and composition, that the battle
of the Higher Criticism chiefly rages. With that we are but
indirectly concerned in considering the Book of Kings; but it is
noticeable that the ablest and most competent defender of the more
conservative criticism, Professor James Robertson, D.D., both in his
contribution to <i>Book by Book</i> and in his <i>Early Religion of Israel</i>, makes large concessions. Thus he says, "It is particularly to be
noticed that in the Book of the Pentateuch itself the Mosaic origin is
not claimed" (<i>Book by Book</i>, p. 5). "The anonymous character of all
the historical writings of the Old Testament would lead us to conclude
that the ancient Hebrews had not the idea of literary property
which we attach to authorship" (p. 8). "It is long since the composite
character of the Pentateuch was observed" (p. 9). "There
may remain doubts as to when the various parts of the Pentateuch
were actually written down; it may be admitted that the later
writers wrote in the light of the events and circumstances of their
own times" (p. 16).</p>

notable feature in the extant redactions of the book is the strong
interest shown in the Deuteronomic law of Moses, and especially in
the centralisation of worship in the Temple on Zion, as pre-supposed
in Deuteronomy and enforced by Josiah. This interest did not exist
in ancient Israel, and is quite foreign to the older memories incorporated
in the book."</p>

in the Septuagint placed <i>after</i> verse 53, are incomplete in the Hebrew
text, and have a remarkable reading in the Targum. Professor
Robertson Smith infers that a Deuteronomic insertion has misplaced
them in one text, and mutilated them in another. The order
of the LXX. differs in 1 Kings iv. 19-27; and it omits 1 Kings vi.
11-14; ix. 15-26. It transposes the story of Naboth, and omits the
story of Ahijah and Abijah, which is added from Aquila's version to
the Alexandrian MS. See Wellhausen-Bleek, <i>Einleitung</i>, §§ 114, 134.</p>

the invasion of Shishak, and the change of the revenue system in the

as due to a mere palace intrigue of Nathan and Bathsheba, and
David's dying injunctions as only intended to excuse Solomon. They
treat 1 Kings ii. 1-12 as a Deuteronomic interpolation. Dillmann,
Kittel, Kuenen, Budde, rightly reject this view. Stade says, "Nach
menschlichen Gefühl, ein Unrecht war die Salbung Salomos." He
thinks that "the aged David was over-influenced by the intrigues of
the harem and the court" (i. 292).</p>

Palestine and the West is shown by the fact that such words as
peribolory, machaera, macaina, lesche, pellex, have found their way
into Hebrew (see Renan, <i>Hist. du Peuple Israel</i>, ii. 33).</p>

keep them only till their wool, milk, and lambs have repaid the
damage; then let him restore them to their owner." David admitted
that this was the more equitable judgment, and he adopted it. See

(2 Sam. xx. 26). An attempt has been made to explain the word away
because it obviously clashes with Levitic ordinances; but the word
"priest" could not be used in two different senses in two consecutive
lines. Dogmatic considerations have tampered with the obvious
meaning of the word. The LXX. omits it, and in the case of David's
sons calls them &#945;&#8016;&#955;&#8049;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#953;. The A.V. renders it "chief officer." The
Vulgate wrongly refers it to Zadok (filius Sadoc <i>sacerdotis</i>). Movers
(<i>Krit. Unters.</i>, 301 ff.) renders it "court chaplains." Already in

instead, "And the sons of David <i>were at the hand of the king</i>" (see
Ewald, <i>Alterthumsk</i>, p. 276). Compare the title "Bishop of Osnaburg,"

by later Jewish tradition to get rid of what they disliked; for in
Eupolemos (Euseb., <i>Præp. Evang.</i>, ix. 34) Hiram is said to belong to the
family of David. "Quite a little romance," as Wellhausen says, "has
been constructed out of the fact that the chronicler assigns his mother
to the tribe of Dan; but it is not worth repeating, being a mass of
hypotheses." To the dislike of Sidonian and semi-Sidonian influence,
we perhaps owe the notion that David had already received a design
from the hand of God Himself (1 Chron. xxviii. 11-19) (Ewald, iii.
227). Jerome mentions the Jewish fable that the artist Hiram was
of the family of Aholiab, the artist of the wilderness.</p>

widely from that of his people (1 Kings xi. 28, xii. 3); for we are told

before the Holiest; but we read of no such curtain in Solomon's,
except in 2 Chron. iii. 14. The fact that the staves of the Ark were
<i>visible</i> seems to show that there was not one. The chronicler speaks
of "<i>the</i> vail" (2 Chron. iii. 14), showing, apparently, that there was
only one; and does not mention the <i>M&#257;sak</i>, which hung between the
Porch and the Holy Place. Except in 2 Chron. iii. 14, the only mention
of either is in the "Priestly Code." Since the Oracle had a door, one
hardly sees why there should also have been a curtain. But the

kept the Feast of Tabernacles. On the 23rd (the eighth day from

brought up to Jerusalem "the Tabernacle of the congregation." But
the LXX. only has &#959;&#7985; &#7985;&#949;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#962;. In 2 Chron. v. 5 the Hebrew text has
"the Levites" in some MSS., or "the priests, the Levites"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the Levitic priests. For "the priests took up the ark" (1 Kings viii. 3)
the chronicler has "the Levites" (comp. Numb. iii. 31, iv. 15). It is
at least doubtful whether the distinction between priests and Levites
is older than the Priestly Code and the days of Ezekiel. Also, the
LXX. in 1 Kings viii. 4 puts "witness" for "congregation," and
some critics maintain that "congregation" (<i>'edah</i>) is post-exilic. (See

It is probably added by a later editor who took the Deuteronomic
standpoint. It is found, sometimes almost word for word, in Lev.
xxvi. and Deut. xxviii.; but there are many variations between the
Hebrew and the LXX., and Kings and Chronicles. Looking only at
actual facts, not at <i>a priori</i> theories, we see that, as Professor Driver
says (<i>Contemporary Review</i>, Feb. 1890), "the Hebrew historians used
some freedom in attributing speeches to historical characters." Thus,
both the syntax and vocabulary, to say nothing of the thoughts of
various speeches attributed to David by the chronicler, are sometimes
such as mark the latest period in the history of the language,
and are often quite without precedent in præ-exilic literature. Some
feelings which gathered round the Temple find expression in Psalms
xxiv., xxvii., xlii., lxxii., lxxxiv., cxxii., and in more extravagant and
less spiritual forms throughout the Talmud. <i>Soteh</i>, f. 48; <i>Berachoth</i>,
f. 591; <i>Moed Qaton</i>, f. 261, etc.</p>

Gesenius thinks that this last title (Psalm ix.) means that the Psalm
"was to be sung by boys with virgins' voices." It is, to say the
least, a very curious coincidence, that in 1 Chron. xxv. 4 the names
of the sons of Heman, Giddalti and Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah,
Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth, mean (omitting the strange Joshbekashah,
for which the LXX. Cod. Alex. reads &#931;&#949;&#946;&#945;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#964;&#8049;&#957;), consecutively,

sin. "The trespass offering affected rights of property, but no precise
definition of the two kinds of expiatory offerings can be based upon
the statements made in the Pentateuch in respect to them. Perhaps
they cannot all be referred to the same time and to one author; for
they prescribe both sin and trespass offerings in cases of Levitical
impurity, and also for moral offences. All Levites attempting to
establish palpable distinctions between them must inevitably fail." (Kalisch, <i>Leviticus</i>, part ii., p. 272). The general scheme of sacrifices,

He considers that 2 Chron. iii. 14 (the only place in the Old Testament

1 Kings vi. 21, which speaks only of chains of gold between the Holy
and the Holiest. (There was a curtain in Herod's Temple, Matt.

not take the cities. Nothing can be made of the allusion to this
transaction in 2 Chron. viii. 1, 2. Why did Solomon re-occupy these
cities? and why did Hiram give him one hundred and twenty talents
of gold? The gloss put on the matter by late tradition cannot conceal
the fact that Solomon tried to diminish his embarrassments by
alienating some of the sacred territory.</p>

the home of Samuel (1 Sam. vii. 16). Dan, too, was "a holy city"
(Judg. xviii. 30, 31; Tobit i. 5, 6). In 1 Kings xii. 30 ("the people
went to worship before the one, even unto Dan") some words may
have dropped out. Klostermann adds, "and neglected Bethel"; but is
that the fact? The LXX. adds, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#949;&#7986;&#945;&#963;&#945;&#957; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7943;&#954;&#959;&#957; &#922;&#965;&#961;&#8055;&#959;&#965;. On the

even as far as Dan some were found who went in preference to Bethel,
"the king's chapel" (Amos vii. 13). In 1 Kings xii. 28 the fairer

to say that we have even a particle of evidence to show that the
name was not added from a marginal gloss or by the latest redactor.
He also makes the mistake of putting into the old prophet's mouth
the phrase "all the cities of Samaria" at least fifty years before
Samaria existed (1 Kings xvi. 24). Keil's remark that "<i>Josiah</i>"
is only used appellatively for one whom Jehovah will support (!) is
one of the miserable expedients of reckless harmonists. Even Bähr,
<i>ad loc.</i>, admits that the narrative is of later date, and has received
a traditional colouring. In 2 Kings xxiii. 15-18 there is no hint that
Josiah had been prophesied of by name.</p>

2 Kings ix. 8) means "every male." The phrase "him that is shut
up and him that is left in Israel" (Deut. xxxii. 36) is obscure and
alliterative. It has been variously explained to mean, (1) "bond and
free," (2) "imprisoned or released," (3) "kept in by legal impurity
or at large" (Jer. xxxvi. 5), (4) "under or over age," (5) "married or unmarried." (Reuss renders the paronomasia, "qu'il soit caché ou

regards parts of the Books of Chronicles as being, in fact, a Jewish

allusion to Jerusalem. Moreover, the queen is called &#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1504;&#1464;&#1500;, which is a Chaldee (Dan. v. 2), or perhaps a North Palestine word. The

Athaliah (?). The word Baal merely meant "Lord"; and perhaps the
fact that at one time it had been freely applied to Jehovah Himself
may have helped to confuse the religious perceptions of the people.
Saul, certainly no idolater, called his son Eshbaal ("the man of Baal");
and it was only the hatred of the name Baal in later times which led
the Jews to alter Baal into Bosheth ("shame"), as in Ishbosheth,
Mephibosheth. David himself had a son named Beeliada ("known to
Baal"), which was altered into Eliada (1 Chron. xiv. 7, iii. 8; 2 Sam.
v. 16; comp. 2 Chron. xvii. 17). We even find the name Bealiah
("Baal is Jah") as one of David's men (1 Chron. xii. 5). Hoshea
too records that Baali ("my Lord") was used of Jehovah, but changed
into Ishi ("my husband") (Hosea ii. 16, 17). It is used simply for
owner ("the baal of an ox") in "the Book of the Covenant" (Exod.
xxi. 28). See Robertson Smith, <i>Rel. of the Semites</i>, 92.</p>

orthodoxy. "The miracle," he says, "is so remarkable,
so much out of keeping with most of the other miracles of Scripture,
that even pious and devout minds may well be perplexed by it, and
we can feel no surprise at the attempts made to explain it. Such
attempts are not inconsistent with the most devout reverence for the
word of God. They are rather, not unfrequently, the result of a just
persuasion that the Eastern mind did not express itself in forms
similar to those of the West" (<i>Elijah</i>, p. 22). He proceeds to protest
against the harsh condemnation of those who thus only try to
interpret the real ideas present in the mind of the writer. He
regards it as perhaps a highly poetic and figurative representation
of the truth that the God of Nature was with Elijah. "The value of
the Prophet's experience is neither heightened by a literal, nor
diminished by a figurative, interpretation of what passed" (p. 24).</p>

interpreter of devout poetry, says: "The vision was to show the fiery
zeal of the Prophet that would amend everything by the storm, the
mild process of God, and proclaim His longsuffering tender nature as
previously the voice did to Moses: hence the scene was so beautifully
changed." Long before him the wise Theodoret had said: &#916;&#953;&#8048; &#948;&#8050;

Irenæus,
still earlier (<i>c. Hær.</i>, iv. 27), saw in the vision an emblem of the difference
between the law and the gospel; and Grotius, following him,
says, "Evangelii figuratio, quod non venit cum vento, terræ motu,
et fulminibus ut lex," Exod. xix. 16 (see Keil, <i>ad loc.</i>, whose illustrations
